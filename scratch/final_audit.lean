import LeanToLambdaBox
/-! Final axiom audit for the dev/verify verification stack (2026-07-07;
re-baselined 2026-08-10 for Lean v4.33.0-rc2 + the `barabbs/lean4lean` ι fork,
re-pinned 2026-08-11 to the reviewed ι interface `1a1ebe8` — head of the fork's
`iota` branch — and re-pinned again 2026-08-27 to `fee3ada` and then `7a5e96d`,
head of the fork's `trproj` branch, which is where `TrProj` stops being a `sorry`
and its motive gets pinned, and once more on 2026-08-28 to `b6a5a38` — round 2 of the
same branch, which corrects `TrEnv.proj_defeq`'s STATEMENT and adds the proved
`TrEnv.pats_iota_inv`, discharging no `sorry` and adding no axiom (71, identical list).
That re-pin moved NOTHING in this file: all 962 entries below came back byte-identical
across it, including the three declarations it forced this repo to DELETE
(`TrProjCtor` and its two conversions, adopted upstream character-identical). The 7a5e96d step discharged no `sorry` and added no
axiom — lean4lean's own count holds at 143 across both revisions — and this file
reported the same 648 entries across it that it had reported immediately before it,
at slice Γ-W3b. [Corrected in the coherence pass, 2026-08-27: that sentence used to
read "the same 648 entries it did at `fee3ada`", which is false — at `fee3ada` this
file reported **596** (commit `5069f9d`); 648 is the Γ-W3b/`7a5e96d` figure, and the
596 → 648 growth is the Γ-W0…Γ-W3b slices, not a no-op re-pin.] It has grown seventeen
times since 648 [recount, coherence pass 2026-08-28: the sentence said "thirteen", which
was right at Γ-U1 and went stale as Γ-U2, Γ-U3 and Γ-U4 appended entries to the list
below without bumping the word; bumped again at proj-R2]:
to 660 at slice proj-P3, to 673 at slice Γ-W3.5, to 691 at slice Γ-W3.6a, to 707 at
slice Γ-W3.6b, to 730 at slices proj-P0/P1/P4, to 750 at slice Γ-W4, to 772 at slice
proj-P2, to 800 at slices proj-P5/P6/P7, to 818 at slice proj-P8, to 850 at slice
proj-P9, to 856 at slice Γ-U, to 886 at slice Γ-W5, to 910 at slice Γ-U1, to 923 at
slice Γ-U2, to 944 at slice Γ-U3, to 962 at slice Γ-U4 and to 975 at slice proj-R2,
with every earlier entry's output byte-identical at each step — at proj-P8, proj-P9, Γ-U, Γ-W5, Γ-U1, Γ-U2, Γ-U3 and Γ-U4 the whole
inherited prefix is (800, 818, 850, 856, 886, 910, 923 and 944 entries respectively),
which is the strongest form of that claim the file can make and the one a slice adding
a premise to 33 signatures, and a slice growing the registry invariant, had to earn.
Γ-U earned it the easy way: it is an **analysis** slice — it changed no signature and
added only two guard theorems, because its finding is that the relaxation it was
commissioned to make would move the fragment's vacuity rather than remove it.
Γ-U1 earned it the same way, one step further: it is a pure lemma kit in one new file
(`ErasesLevels.lean`), with no consumer yet, so it edits no existing declaration at all —
its twenty-one entries are all `sorryAx`-free, and the 886-entry prefix was checked by
diffing a full run against a run of the same file with the new module stashed.
Γ-U2 earned it the hard way and it is the more interesting case: it **does** edit
signatures — four scope pins from `= Us` to `<+: Us`, plus the oracle discharge's kernel
disjunct — and the 910-entry prefix still came back byte-identical, because relaxing those
pins needed no proof repair anywhere. Its own thirteen entries include six guards, all
`sorryAx`-free; `ResidualHyps.toBridgeHyps` keeps the set it had. The slice's one real
cost is not visible as an axiom at all: the verified kernel branch of the oracle discharge
now covers a strictly smaller set of readers (those at the ambient scope), which is a
premise change and is recorded in `OracleDischarge`'s docstring rather than here.
Γ-U3 earned it Γ-U1's way again — one new file (`ErasesInstL.lean`), one import line, no
edited declaration — and its twenty-one entries are all `sorryAx`-free. Its axiom story is
worth one line: the pure `VExpr`-side lemmas take nothing, the level layer takes
`Lean.Level.hasParam_eq` (the model axiom for the opaque `Level.data` bit `substParams'`
branches on), and the `Expr.instantiateLevelParams` wrappers inherit that function's
`Expr`-model set, including the two `bv_decide` natives the lakefile already records
against `TrExprS.instL`. No axiom of ours, no `sorry`, no `native_decide`.
Γ-U4 earned it the Γ-U2 way, and it is the harder of the two cases: it edits real
signatures — `SEvalDataι`'s δ *constructor*, the ι simulation's `hcon` plus two new
premises, the ι capstone's new `hlp` row, `SEvalDataι_defeq_of_shape`'s — and the 944-entry
prefix still came back byte-identical. The reason is one `rfl`:
`Expr.instantiateLevelParams` short-circuits on `paramNames.isEmpty`, so at the universe
column's default (`ErasureCtx.lparams := fun _ => []`) the restated δ rule and the restated
consistency premise *are* the old ones definitionally, and none of the four
`SEnvConsistent` discharges, none of the δ records and none of the walk conversions had to
move. Of its eighteen entries, fifteen are new declarations and three are the crown
re-print; fourteen of the fifteen are `sorryAx`-free. The fifteenth is
`SEnvConsistentL.levels_collapse`, which carries the same inherited unique-typing item
(`TrExprS.uniq`) that its `Ups = ⊥` corollary `SEnvConsistent.levels_collapse` has carried
since slice Γ-U — the entry for that corollary is in the byte-identical prefix, which is
the check that the reframing changed nothing but the framing. Four entries carry the
`Expr`-model set (`mkData_eq`, `mkAppData_eq`, `replace_eq`, `Level.hasParam_eq` and the
two `bv_decide` natives the lakefile already records) and carry it for the reason Γ-U3
recorded: they go through `Expr.instantiateLevelParams_eq`. No axiom of ours, no `sorry`,
no `native_decide`.
The projection round's model-layer entries are **all
`sorryAx`-free** bar one — proj-P2's
`Erases.strengthen_fvlift_binders`, which is the defeq-route strengthening and inherits the
same `TrProj.uniq` item `erases_strengthen_closed` has carried since `fee3ada`; that slice
kept the equational `Erases.strengthen_fvlift` beside it precisely so that no declaration
which was clean stopped being clean, and the 750-entry prefix confirms it. Γ-W4's twenty are
`sorryAx`-free too, bar the one that restates a first-order-value
fixture (`envRec_foC`, whose set is its `envFO`/`envδ` siblings' verbatim — the inherited
unique-typing item, reached through `IsDefEq.uniqU`).
The crown four did not move at any of them.

The projection round's **step** entries (P5/P6/P7) are the first of it to carry
`sorryAx`, and it is not new: `SEvalDataι_defeq` and `erases_correct_dataι` carried it
before the round and their sets are byte-identical after it, and `projConsistent_of_*`
inherits the same unique-typing item its ι twin `iotaConsistent_of_shape` does — with a
strictly smaller set, because a projection's reduct is a subterm and needs no application
generation. The round adds no axiom, no `sorry` and no `native_decide` of ours.

**The Γ-XL wave, closed.** Γ-W0 → Γ-W4 took the recursion wall down from both sides: the
bridge walks `visitMutual`'s recursive exit (Γ-W3.6b) and the capstones no longer exclude
recursive programs (Γ-W4). Over the wave's measured tail — Γ-W3.5 through Γ-W4, 673 → 750
entries [the figure read "746" from the day it was written, `9c185e5`; that commit's own
message and the list above both say **750**, so it was a typo, corrected in the coherence
pass 2026-08-28] — the crown four moved **once, and downward**, when the `trproj` re-pin took
`sorryAx` out of the refinement half. No slice of the wave added an axiom, a `sorry` or a
`native_decide`, and none changed a byte of the shipping eraser.)

Allowed: ⊆ [propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound] + lean4lean's
modeling axioms (`Verify/Axioms.lean`, `PtrEq.lean`) where the executable
checker / `Expr` model is involved. The pure-LBTerm layers must be sorryAx-free.

## lean4lean-side baseline drift at the 2026-08-10 repoint

Nothing of ours changed: no axiom of ours was added, and every result below that
was sorryAx-free before is still sorryAx-free. The lean4lean modeling set moved:

* **Discharged upstream, so they no longer appear**: `Lean.Expr.hasFVar_eq`,
  `Lean.Expr.hasExprMVar_eq`, `Lean.Expr.hasLevelMVar_eq`,
  `Lean.Expr.hasLevelParam_eq` (now theorems) and `Lean.Expr.mkAppRangeAux.eq_def`
  (now proved).
* **Added upstream by the `Level` standardization**: `Lean.Level.normalize_eq`
  (reached by the deep kernel-checker cluster below), plus `Lean.Level.mkMaxAux_eq`,
  `Lean.Level.skipExplicit_eq`, `Lean.Level.isExplicitSubsumedAux_eq` (declared
  upstream, not reached from anything audited here).
* **`bv_decide` native-LRAT artifacts** from lean4lean's `Verify/Expr.lean`:
  `Lean.Expr.mkData_flags._native.bv_decide.ax_*` and
  `Lean.Expr.Data.looseBVarRange_le._native.bv_decide.ax_*`. lean4lean-side SAT
  certificates; they occur only in the executable-checker cluster (WS-O below).
* **`sorryAx` reach grew upstream** (the fork's twelve `IOTA-TODO(soundness)`
  items: `Aligned.addInduct`, `addInduct_WF`, the `IsDefEq`/`IsDefEqStrong` `pat`
  inversion cases, …). This widens the *inherited* trust boundary but does not
  reach any result here that was previously clean.

## The 2026-08-11 re-pin to the reviewed ι interface (`1a1ebe8`)

The fork's ι-witness commit was reviewed and landed as `1a1ebe8`; the statement of
`TrEnv.pats_iota'` — which `PatsIotaSpec` copies verbatim — is unchanged, and no
audited axiom set below moves. Two review-side facts worth recording:

* The reviewer **kept `TrEnv'.of_value` routed through `Aligned`** (rejecting the
  proposed `map_wf → constMap_wf` de-tainting), so `of_value` still inherits the
  `Aligned.addInduct` `sorry`. Nothing here uses it: the ι chain's δ step goes through
  `SEnvConsistent`. Same taint as at the previous pin, no drift.
* The fork's `sorry` count is unchanged (`Aligned.addInduct` and
  `VInductDecl.WF`'s inductive lemma remain), so the inherited boundary is the same.

New entry: `PatsIotaSpec.of_trEnv`, the discharge of `PatsIotaSpec` from a `TrEnv`.

## The 2026-08-27 re-pin to the TrProj delivery (`fee3ada`)

**This is the largest single movement the audit has ever recorded, and it is almost
entirely SHRINKAGE.** The commissioned round (A0–A3) gave `TrProj` a real definition —
an ι-pattern membership in `env.pats` plus a `HasType` conjunct — where the ι pin had a
`sorry`-valued `def`. Measured here, not quoted: `#print axioms Lean4Lean.TrProj` is now
`[propext]`.

That one fact is the whole story of the shrinkage. `sorryAx` used to enter this
development through the **type** of `TrExprS`, so *every* statement that so much as
mentioned `Erases`, `TrExprS`, `BridgeInv` or `DeltaHyps` carried it whether or not its
proof did anything projection-shaped. With the definition in place that channel is
closed, and what is left is only what the PROOFS actually use.

Measured old → new over this file's 584 entries:

* **139 entries (111 distinct declarations) LOST `sorryAx`**, gaining nothing.
* **3 entries (3 distinct declarations) GAINED two axioms** — see below.
* Entries carrying `sorryAx` at all: **230 → 91** (48 distinct declarations).
* Everything else is byte-identical, including the four crown theorems.

### The headline: the bridge is now sorryAx-free

`visitExpr_refines_erases` — the theorem that the shipping eraser refines `Erases` — and
its `_core` and `_block` forms now print

    [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound, Lean.Expr.instantiate1_eq,
     Lean.PersistentArray.toList'_push, Lean.PersistentHashMap.WF.find?_eq,
     Lean.PersistentHashMap.WF.toList'_insert]

with **no `sorryAx`**. So do `BridgeInv` and all its transports, `DeltaHyps`, `DeltaMem`,
`RunConclδ`, `ColdStartSubject`, `RecEnvConsistent`, every `Erases` transport lemma
(`abstract`, `uninstantiate{,N}`, `thin_vlet`, `strengthen_vlet`, `shift`, `subst`,
`weakFV`, `weak_any`, `fix_of_open{,_nil}`, `fix_of_closed`), the whole `registeredClosure`
/`erasesEnvDelta` δ family, `erases_rec_block_of_run`, `recEnvConsistent_of_block`, every
`g*` guard in that chain, and `PatsIotaSpec.of_trEnv` and `TrExprS.mkApps_inv` on the ι
side. The *refinement* half of the development no longer inherits anything from lean4lean
beyond the `Expr`/`PersistentHashMap` modelling axioms.

### What still carries `sorryAx`, and this is the provenance correction

The residue is now confined to the **forward-simulation** half — `erases_correct*`,
`eraseCore_correct`, the `SEval*` evaluation lemmas, the ι spine construction, and hence
the four capstones. Measured upstream at `fee3ada`, the live sources are:

1. **`Lean4Lean.TrExprS.uniq` → `Lean4Lean.TrProj.uniq`** — one of the two remaining
   `PROJ-TODO(soundness)` items. 69 downstream call sites of `.uniq`, 31 of them in
   `ErasesCorrectData.lean` alone, then `ErasesCorrect.lean` (11),
   `ErasesCorrectIota.lean` (7), `ErasesUniform.lean` (4), `FirstOrder.lean` (2),
   `ErasesStrengthen.lean` (2), `SubjectReductionFull.lean` (1). This is the densest
   single line of inherited debt in the development.
2. **`Lean4Lean.VEnv.IsDefEq.uniqU`** — the unique-typing development, `sorry`-carrying
   both through `IsDefEqU.weakN_iff` (which is exactly commission item C1, NOT discharged
   this round) and through the ι fork's `pat` cases. It reaches us through
   `TrProj.defeqDFC`, `TrExpr.app`/`TrExpr.proj`, and `TrExprS.instL` — note that
   `TrProj.instL` itself came back PROVED and clean (`[propext, Quot.sound]`); it is the
   `TrExpr` smart constructors around it that are dirty.
3. **`Lean4Lean.VEnv.HasType.app_inv`** (`Theory/Typing/Strong.lean`) — the ι spine
   construction, reaching `iotaConsistent_of_shape` and `iota_defeq_spine`.
4. **`Lean4Lean.Aligned.addInduct`** — the ι fork's environment-alignment `IOTA-TODO`.

**The two remaining `PROJ-TODO`s that do NOT reach us:** `TrProj.weak'_inv` (nothing here
calls `TrExprS.weakFV'_inv`/`weakFV_inv` — the `ErasesUniform` design deliberately routed
around it) and `TrEnv.proj_defeq` (a new interface, not yet consumed; see step 4 of the
consumability note in `ColdStart.lean`).

**Retired as sources, and every annotation in this file that named them is corrected in
place below:** `TrProj` the definition, `TrProj.weak'`, `TrProj.weakN`, `TrProj.mono`,
`TrProj.instL`, `TrProj.wf` — all proved upstream — and with them
`TrExprS.weakFV'`, `.weakBV`, `.mono`, `.instN`, `.weakFV`, `.inst`, `.weak_nil`,
`.mkApps_inv`, and `TrEnv.pats_iota'`, all now sorryAx-free.

### The growth, and it did NOT come from the commissioned work

`trproj` is a **merge of upstream `master`**, so this pin also absorbs master's
level-normalization rewrite, the K-target flag fix and `lazyDeltaProjReduction`. Two
axioms enter the audited surface with it:

* `Std.TreeMap.all_eq_all_toList` — a genuinely NEW `axiom` in lean4lean's
  `Verify/Axioms.lean` (added there together with `any_eq_any_toList`, which nothing here
  reaches), standing in for a `Std` lemma Lean does not yet prove
  (leanprover/lean4#12798).
* `Lean.Level.isExplicitSubsumedAux_eq` — declared upstream already at the `1a1ebe8` pin,
  and recorded above as "not reached from anything audited here". It is reached now, via
  master's `Verify/LevelStd.lean`.

Both arrive on the same path, the **executable kernel-checker cluster** — the same place
`Lean.Level.normalize_eq` already lived — and they touch exactly three entries:
`Lean4Lean.TypeChecker.kernel_isErasable_sound`, `ResidualHyps.toBridgeHyps`, and
`shipping_visitExpr_correct'`. They do NOT enter through the ι `_of_shape` cluster;
`iotaConsistent_of_shape` is byte-identical across the re-pin.

No axiom of ours was added. No `sorry` of ours exists.

-- ι Task 2: the pattern-side ι interface (`IotaPattern.lean`) + its guard
-- (`IotaDischarge.lean`).
--
-- The pure pattern plumbing (`Matches` introduction for spines, the
-- `SimplePattern.iotaRHS` reduct calculation) must be **sorryAx-free**: it touches
-- only `Pattern`/`VExpr`, never `TrExprS`.
--
-- REVISED 2026-08-27 at the `fee3ada` re-pin; the old reading of this block blamed
-- `TrProj`, and for two of the three entries below that is now simply false.
--
--   `TrExprS.mkApps_inv` is sorryAx-FREE. It is a pure `.app`-indexed `cases` inversion,
--     so its `sorryAx` was never anything but the definitional taint `TrProj` put in the
--     TYPE of `TrExprS`. A1 removed that taint and the entry went clean.
--   `PatsIotaSpec.of_trEnv` is sorryAx-FREE, because `TrEnv.pats_iota'` itself measures
--     clean at `fee3ada`. `PatsIotaSpec` remains a HYPOTHESIS structure, never an axiom,
--     and it remains DISCHARGED. What survives in its set is only lean4lean's three
--     `PersistentHashMap` `ConstMap` modelling axioms (`findAux_isSome`, `WF.find?_eq`,
--     `WF.toList'_insert`), which come in through the `constMap_wf`/`find?_insert` steps
--     of `pats_iota'`'s induction over `TrEnv'`. Still a strict SUBSET of
--     `shipping_visitExpr_correct'`'s, so nothing here is new, and it still does NOT pick
--     up `Aligned.addInduct` — `pats_iota'` is routed through `TrEnv'.constMap_wf`, not
--     `map_wf`.
--   `iota_defeq_spine` STAYS dirty, and for a reason that has nothing to do with
--     projections: it is a genuine consumer of the ι fork's `IsDefEq.pat` /
--     `Aligned.addInduct` sorries and of `VEnv.HasType.app_inv`. Its set is unmoved
--     across the re-pin, byte for byte.
--
-- The constructed guard `envι_iota_fires` must be **sorryAx-free**: it builds its
-- `VEnv` with `VEnv.addPat` directly and applies `VEnv.IsDefEq.pat`, neither of which
-- routes through `Aligned.addInduct`/`addInduct_WF`. (The δ-unfold step of
-- the remaining chain WOULD route through `Aligned.addInduct` via `TrEnv.of_value` —
-- documented in `IotaDischarge.lean`, not exercised here.)

-- `iotaConsistent_of_shape`.
--
-- `iotaConsistent_of_shape` picks up lean4lean's `Lean.Expr`-implementation modelling
-- axioms (`mkData_eq`, `mkAppData_eq`, `replace_eq`, `Level.hasMVar_eq`,
-- `Level.hasParam_eq`, `Level.instLawfulBEqLevel`, and two `bv_decide` native checks in

-- level-instantiating a polymorphic recursor rule. They are NOT new: its axiom set is a
-- strict SUBSET of the already-committed `shipping_visitExpr_correct'`'s. No axiom of
-- ours; `PatsIotaSpec`/`SEnvConsistent`/`IotaShape` are hypotheses, never axioms.
--
-- The two `IotaShape` `Expr`-equation guards must be `rfl`-provable and essentially
-- axiom-free (`[propext]`): they are closed `Expr` computations.
--
-- [2026-08-27, `fee3ada`: this block's provenance was already RIGHT — it named
-- `HasType.app_inv` and `IsDefEq.uniqU`, not `TrProj` — and it is the one ι block that

-- `Lean.Level.isExplicitSubsumedAux_eq`; those enter only the executable-checker cluster.

-- PROOFS consume unique typing: the `casesOn`-spine inversions in `ErasesCorrectData.lean`
-- alone hold 31 of the 69 downstream `.uniq` call sites, and `.uniq` bottoms out in
-- `TrProj.uniq` (`PROJ-TODO`) and `IsDefEq.uniqU` (C1 + the ι `pat` cases). Section-local

--
-- AXIOM EXPECTATION (measured, 2026-08-10):
--
--   `…firstorderι` and `…firstorderι_registered` print the axiom set of
--   `shipping_erase_correct_firstorder` **verbatim** — 4 standard + the 4 lean4lean
--   `Lean.Expr`/`PersistentHashMap` modelling axioms. The ι machinery contributes
--   nothing: `erases_correct_dataι` is [propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound],
--   and every ι side condition (`IotaConsistent`, `IotaRelevant`, `IotaShape`,
--   `IotaArityCoherent`, `CtorFieldsCoherent`, `ClosedEnv`, `ErasesEnvCases(ι)`,
--   `PatsIotaSpec`) is a `Prop` HYPOTHESIS, never an axiom. (`FlatCaseFields` was one
--   too, and is gone from the capstones entirely since ι-S4b.)
--
--   `…firstorderι_of_shape` prints those EIGHT MORE, and only these eight:
--
--     Lean.Expr.mkAppData_eq, Lean.Expr.mkData_eq, Lean.Expr.replace_eq,
--     Lean.Level.hasMVar_eq, Lean.Level.hasParam_eq, Lean.Level.instLawfulBEqLevel,
--     Lean.Expr.mkData_flags._native.bv_decide.ax_1_12,
--     Lean.Expr.Data.looseBVarRange_le._native.bv_decide.ax_1_7
--
--   They enter through `iotaConsistent_of_shape` → `TrExprS.instL` (level-instantiating
--   a polymorphic recursor rule) and are lean4lean's own `Lean.Expr`/`Lean.Level`
--   implementation-model axioms plus its two `bv_decide` SAT certificates. They are NOT
--   new: this eight-element set is a strict SUBSET of the already-committed
--   `shipping_visitExpr_correct'`'s (printed above). NO AXIOM OF OURS, anywhere.
--
--   Note the earlier T2 note is about `iotaConsistent_of_shape` vs
--   `shipping_visitExpr_correct'` (the *primed* theorem, the executable-checker
--   cluster) — NOT vs `shipping_erase_correct_firstorder`, whose set is much smaller.
--   Hence the eight-axiom delta on the `_of_shape` form is expected, not a regression.
--
-- The Γ/E certificate block guards must be **sorryAx-free**: they are pure
-- `ErasureCtx`/`GlobalDeclarations` computations, with no `Erases`/`TrExprS` content.
-- `envFO_foC_ι` inherits `sorryAx` via `TrExprS`, as `envFO_foC_d` already does.

-- peano tower comes out of the existing `ctor_head`/`app` rules and no new target-side
-- machinery (`WcbvEval`, `FirstOrderValue`, `eraseCore`) is involved. Machine-`Nat`
-- (`.prim`) remains out of scope, so the machine-mode results are unchanged.
--

-- COLD-START SLICE S1 (2026-08-12): the registration-path run lemmas and the
-- registry invariant `RegInvShape`.
--
-- Everything here is pure `EraseM`-run / `GlobalDeclarations` reasoning: no
-- `Erases`, no `TrExprS`, no lean4lean. Expected axiom set for every entry below:
-- ⊆ [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]. **No `sorryAx`** — in particular the
-- run lemmas do not inherit lean4lean's, since they never touch the model.
--
-- What changed in the trust ledger:
--
--   * `Erasure.run_getConstInfo_state` (and `run_getEnv_state`,
--     `run_mkFreshFVarId_state`, `run_logInfo_state`) are THEOREMS. The
--     `s = s₁` clauses that `DataBridgeHyps.ctorinfo_run`/`indinfo_run`/
--     `extern_run` and `CasesBridgeHyps.casesind_run` assume for those very
--     primitives are therefore redundant — they can be dropped from the bundles.
--
--   * `Erasure.run_register_inductive_cold_ok` shows the cold branch conses one
--     `.inductiveDecl` entry (plus one axiom entry per `@[extern]` constructor).
--     `DataBridgeHyps.reg_run` and `CasesBridgeHyps.casesreg_run` asserted
--     `s = s₁` for `register_inductive` over an ARBITRARY `s`, which this
--     refutes as a statement about the real function. REPAIRED in slice S2
--     (below): both clauses are gone, and the counter-argument against the
--     D3/D3ι `_registered` capstones' premise set is retired with them.
--
--   * `Erasure.run_addAxiom_ok` records the panic fall-through (`addAxiom`'s
--     guard has no `return`, and `panic!` succeeds at `EraseM`), so the post-state
--     is the modified one on BOTH branches.

-- metatheory the output-shape induction needs.
--
-- Same expectation: ⊆ [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound], no `sorryAx`.
--
--   * `Erasure.run_visitMutual_ok` is the DAG engine's Hoare rule over its four
--     exits (axiom / non-recursive constant / recursive block / inlining-only
--     bookkeeping). It takes the `visitExpr` fact as a HYPOTHESIS, so it is
--     usable inside `visitExpr.mutual_fixpoint_induct` — where the step goals
--     are about an abstract function, not the real `visitExpr` — as well as
--     standalone. The recursive exit is *handled*, not refuted: `hrec` receives
--     the `.fix` conses, which is what lets `RegInvShape`'s disjunctive `nofix`
--     absorb the recursion wall with no restructuring.
--
--   * Exactly one hypothesis of `run_visitMutual_ok` is assumed rather than
--     proved: `hprep`, that `prepare_erasure` leaves the predicate alone. Its
--     `csimp` branch runs `Lean.Core.transform` *at* `EraseM` through
--     `MonadControlT`, so state transparency does not follow from the `liftM`
--     lemmas. It belongs with `PrepareHyps`. Slice S4's `erase_run_ok` (R1)
--     needs the same fact.
--
--   * `LeanToLambdaBox.OutputShape` supplies the binder metatheory: `toBvar`
--     preserves `NoFix` and shifts `LBClosed` by one level, plus the fold forms
--     `mkAlt`/`mkDef` need.

--
--   * `RegInvShape.recConst` completes the `run_visitMutual_ok` interface: all
--     four exits now have their closure lemma. Its two inputs are honest
--     assumptions, not gaps in the argument: `KeysDistinct` of the final
--     `gdecls` (nothing in `visitMutual` rules out shadowing — it tests neither
--     `s.gdecls` nor `s.constants` before consing), and closedness of the stored
--     `.fix` bodies (the recursion wall's `closeFix` result).
--
--   * `RegInvShape.constCons` generalises `nonrecConst`: the stored body may be
--     plain (`NoFix`) or a literal `.fix`, which is exactly the disjunction
--     `NoFixEnvD` carries. The recursive and non-recursive exits are then the
--     same lemma at the two disjuncts.
--
--   * The binder-helper run lemmas each carry an `r = default` fall-through
--     disjunct: every destructuring helper `panic!`s on a shape mismatch, and a
--     panic SUCCEEDS at `EraseM`. That is the code's real behaviour.

-- COLD-START SLICE S1d (2026-08-12): the output-shape induction (R11).
--
-- Same expectation: ⊆ [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound], no `sorryAx`.
-- This layer is pure `LBTerm`/`EraseM` reasoning — it touches neither lean4lean
-- nor the `Erases` relation — so the bound is tight, not inherited.
--
--   * `visitExpr_shape` is the 18-motive fixpoint induction over the erasure
--     family, in Hoare form over a state predicate `Q` closed under the six
--     places the family writes to `ErasureState` (`RunClosed`). Stating it over
--     an abstract `Q` is what lets `visitMutual` — the only writer — be handled
--     INSIDE the induction, where the step goal mentions the fixpoint's abstract
--     `visitExpr` argument rather than the real function.
--
--   * `visitExpr_noFix_closed` is R11 with NO hypotheses: `RunClosed` holds
--     outright at `fun _ => True` (`runClosed_true`), which collapses the state
--     half and leaves "every successful `visitExpr` run returns a fix-free,
--     de-Bruijn-closed term". That is exactly the obligation
--     `regInvShape_nonrec_cons_iff` proved the registry invariant owes at
--     `visitMutual`'s non-recursive constant cons — so S1's last prerequisite is
--     discharged, and `runClosed_true` doubles as the class's non-vacuity guard.
--
--   * `RunClosed.regInvShape` instantiates the induction at `RegInvShape Γ`.
--     Four of the six closure fields are PROVED from S1's step lemmas; what is
--     left sits in one named record, `RegShapeHyps`, of exactly two kinds — key
--     freshness (the code tests neither `s.gdecls` nor injectivity of
--     `toKername`) and `Γ`-agreement for the block being registered (slice S4's
--     `RegBridgeHyps`) — plus `recClosed` (the recursion wall's `closeFix`
--     result) and `prep` (`PrepareHyps` class, as in R7).
--
--   * The two matcher lemmas are stated against elaborator-generated matchers
--     (`visitCases.match_7`, `visitConstructor.match_1`): name-pattern matchers
--     compile to `Name.rec` + `String` `dite`s that `split` cannot take apart at
--     a hypothesis whose subject is the match APPLIED to the monad's arguments.
--     If either shipping match is edited the index moves — build error, not
--     unsoundness.
--
--   * `run_nonrec_exit_ok` / `run_rec_exit_ok` were generalized over the erasure
--     function (`{vE : Expr → EraseM LBTerm}`) for this induction; strictly more
--     general, `run_visitMutual_ok` instantiates `vE := visitExpr`.

-- COLD-START SLICE S2 (2026-08-12): the bridge goes cold-startable.
--
-- Expectation: the bridge keeps its lean4lean boundary
-- (`[propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` + the `Expr`/`PersistentX`
-- modeling axioms); the new `ErasureRun` layer is ⊆ [propext, Classical.choice,
-- Quot.sound], no `sorryAx` — it is pure `EraseM` state reasoning.
--
-- WHAT CHANGED IN THE TRUST LEDGER — six assumed clauses deleted, none added:
--
--   * PROVABLE, hence deleted: the `s = s₁` conjuncts of
--     `DataBridgeHyps.ctorinfo_run` / `indinfo_run` / `extern_run`,
--     `CasesBridgeHyps.casesind_run`, and `BridgeHyps.fresh_run` /
--     `ResidualHyps.fresh_run`. The bridge now derives each from
--     `Erasure.run_getConstInfo_state` / `run_getEnv_state` /
--     `run_mkFreshFVarId_state`.
--
--   * FALSE, hence deleted: the `s = s₁` conjuncts of `DataBridgeHyps.reg_run`
--     and `CasesBridgeHyps.casesreg_run` (S1's finding above). They are NOT
--     re-added under a pre-registration precondition — the call sites cannot
--     establish one — and the remaining content of both fields (`r.1 = iid`, the
--     trivial argmasks) is branch-independent. What replaces them is a THEOREM,
--     `Erasure.run_register_inductive_runConcl`, assembled from R5 (hit branch:
--     state preserved) and R4 (miss branch: state only grows).
--
--   * The one side condition ADDED is not a trust assumption but a constraint on
--     the parameter `Γ`: `BridgeInv.knames` (`Γ.constants = toKername`, the
--     design's `hknames`). It is discharged at every concrete `Γ` in the
--     development (`ΓFOd`/`ΓFOι` define `constants := toKername`) and is passed
--     explicitly through the guards below.
--
-- WHAT THE BRIDGE NOW CONCLUDES: `s' = s` widened to `Erasure.RunConcl s s'` —
-- `StateLe` (both registries grow, `gdecls` is only prepended to) plus
-- preservation of `CanonicalConstants`. `BridgeInv.consts` went from
-- completeness (`known n → s.constants.get? n = some (Γ.constants n)`) to
-- soundness (`s.constants.get? n = some k → k = Γ.constants n`, i.e.
-- `RegInvShape.kn`), which is what survives state growth; the completeness
-- direction survives only as `known_dom` (domain membership, monotone in
-- `StateLe`).
--
-- [SUPERSEDED by δ-D4a, below: motive 6 has content, motive 5's miss branch is
-- proved, and `known_dom` is deleted. The diagnosis in this paragraph is right
-- about what it costs and wrong about where it lives — the fix was not a new
-- `RegBridgeHyps` field but the scope-side bundle `DeltaHyps`.]
--
-- WHAT DID NOT LAND: motive 6 (`visitMutual`) stays `True` and motive 5's MISS
-- branch stays refuted by `known_dom` rather than proved. The design's §5.3
-- claim that the miss branch "discharges from slice 1's motive 6" does not go
-- through: S1's `visitMutual_regInvShape` is about the REAL `visitMutual`, while
-- the bridge's step 5 sees the fixpoint's abstract approximation, and giving
-- motive 6 real content inside this induction requires the abstract `visitExpr`
-- to deliver `NoFix`/`LBClosed` of its output (`RunClosed.nrc`) — i.e. merging
-- the whole S1d induction into this one. Independently, motive 5's miss branch
-- would need two facts unavailable here: that `visitMutual n` registers `n`
-- (its recursive exit registers the block names read out of the opaque
-- `Compiler.LCNF.getDeclInfo?`) and generator-monotonicity of `visitMutual`'s
-- primitives. Both are `RegBridgeHyps`-class obligations of the cold-start
-- entry slice (S4), where the design already places them.

-- The Nat-literals wall, slice L3 (2026-08-12): the fragment and the bridge.
--
-- The literal now has a `Supported` rule and a `visitExpr` dispatch, so the wall's
-- model core (L1) and its source/target semantics (L2) are reachable from the shipping
-- eraser. Three statement changes, all additive or vacuous-at-the-default:
--
--   * `Supported.natLit` — a `Nat` literal at a `Γ` that declares peano mode
--     (`Γ.natPeano`, `ErasureContext.lean`) and registers `Nat`'s two constructors at
--     their real kernel indices. `.strVal` stays out at EVERY `Γ` (the shipping
--     `visitLiteral` `panic!`s on it); machine-`Nat` stays out because at
--     `Γ.natPeano = false` the rule is unusable — both are guarded in `Bridge.lean`.
--
--   * `BridgeInv.natcfg : Γ.natPeano = true → ctx.config.nat = .peano` — the config pin.
--     `Supported` is syntactic in `(known, Γ)` and cannot see the reader's config, so
--     the flag lives in `Γ` and is cashed in here against the run whose branch selection
--     depends on it. Vacuous at `Γ.natPeano = false`, hence the machine-mode bridge
--     theorem is EXACTLY as strong as before. It is a side condition on the parameter
--     `Γ` (like S2's `knames` and W3.1's fixvar agreement), NOT a trust assumption:
--     the construction sites (`gBridgeInv_nil`, the three in-file guards) take it as an
--     explicit hypothesis and every existing caller discharges it by `simp`.
--
--   * motive 2 (`visitLiteral`) went from `True` to content, and motive 3
--     (`visitConstructor`) relaxed `cn ≠ Nat.zero → cn ≠ Nat.succ` to the disjunction
--     `ctx.config.nat = .peano ∨ (cn ≠ Nat.zero ∧ cn ≠ Nat.succ)`. The relaxation only
--     ADMITS more calls (under peano the machine-`Nat` arms of `visitConstructor` are
--     dead for every `cn`); `Supported.ctorApp` is NOT relaxed, so motives 13/14 keep
--     their disequalities and pass the right disjunct.
--
-- Expectation: no axiom of ours, and no movement. The literal path introduces no new
-- primitive and no new trust clause — `visitLiteral` calls `visitConstructor`, whose
-- `DataBridgeHyps` clauses are keyed on `Γ.ctors` and hence already cover `Nat.zero` /
-- `Nat.succ` (both are non-`@[extern]` in the real kernel, and the argmask slice is
-- trivial at `numParams = 0`, `numFields ∈ {0,1}`). The recursion
-- `visitLiteral → visitConstructor → visitAppArgs → visitExpr → visitLiteral` is carried
-- by the fixpoint induction itself, so no measure and no new admissibility obligation.

-- The Nat-literals wall, slice L4 (2026-08-12): capstones and the end-to-end guard.
--
-- CAPSTONE RIPPLE: none at the statement level. Every capstone
-- (`shipping_visitExpr_correct{,_data}`, `shipping_erase_correct_firstorder{,ι}` and the
-- `_registered` forms) takes `BridgeInv` as a PREMISE, so the new `natcfg` field costs
-- them nothing; only the places that *build* an invariant gained the side condition
-- `Γ.natPeano = true → cfg.nat = .peano` — `gBridgeInv_nil` and the five guards. That is
-- the same shape as S2's `hkn` and W3.1's `hnfv`, and every existing caller discharges it
-- by `simp` (their `Γ`s leave `natPeano` at its `false` default).
--
-- THE END-TO-END GUARD: D3 (`shipping_erase_correct_firstorder`) fires on the raw
-- literal node `2` in peano mode. What the wall contributes is constructed, not assumed:
--
--   * `envNatT` — `Nat : Sort 1`, `Nat.zero : Nat`, `Nat.succ : Nat → Nat` as typed
--     axioms (`envNatT_wf`), the smallest `VEnv` in which a literal's own `TrExprS`
--     witness exists: lean4lean translates `.lit l` THROUGH `Literal.toConstructor`, so
--     the witness is a `Nat.succ` spine and needs the constructors declared and typed.
--     `envNatLit` (L1) only declares `Nat`, which is all `ContainsLits` needs.
--   * `trExprS_natLit` / `trExprS_srcNatTower` — the literal and its value land on the
--     SAME `vNatTower n`. That is lean4lean's own literal rule, and it is why subject
--     reduction for literals was free in L2.
--   * `sevalDataC_natLit`, `erasesEnvCtor_natLit`, `firstOrderValue_srcNatTower`.
--
-- Hypothetical, per precedent: the run, the three trust bundles, `NoBlock t`, and the
-- single lean4lean-blocked arity side condition `harity` — the very one `FirstOrder.lean`
-- carries for `envFO` (`.const`-vs-arity defeq injectivity is not exposed by the pin).
--
-- SCOPE, stated so it is not over-read: this is the `Expr.lit` node. A source-level
-- numeral `(5 : Nat)` is `@OfNat.ofNat Nat (lit 5) (instOfNatNat (lit 5))`, whose
-- `OfNat.ofNat` body erases to an `LBTerm.proj`; `Erases` is projection-free by design,
-- so a user-written numeral still does not δ-unfold in the model. `Nat.add` is
-- `@[extern]`, hence an axiom under the shipping default. Neither is touched by this
-- wall. [2026-08-27: the parenthetical used to read "(lean4lean's `TrProj` is a
-- `sorry`)", i.e. it gave the UPSTREAM gap as the reason `Erases` has no projection rule.
-- That reason is gone — A1 gave `TrProj` a real definition, so an `Erases.proj` rule is
-- now WRITABLE. The restriction that survives is ours and is downstream work: `Supported`
-- has no `.proj` rule (`Bridge.lean`), and `NoProj` is what the `box` arm of the
-- uniformity argument pays for. The scope statement above is still correct; only its
-- justification changed.]
--
-- Expectation: no axiom of ours; `envNatT_wf` and the typing lemmas carry lean4lean's
-- `VEnv.WF` machinery exactly as `envFO_wf` does.

-- WHY OUTSIDE. The shape half (S1d) travels as a state predicate `Q : ErasureState →
-- Prop`; a state predicate has no room to mention the `visitExpr` run whose OUTPUT is
-- being stored, so it cannot carry an `Erases` witness for it. Widening it is not
-- available either: inside `visitExpr.mutual_fixpoint_induct` the step goal for
-- `visitMutual` sees the fixpoint's ABSTRACT erasure argument. And the bridge induction
-- cannot host the content — that is S2's recorded finding (motive 6 stays `True`). So the
-- δ content is composed about the REAL functions, from `run_visitMutual_decomp`.
--
-- WHAT IS PROVED FROM THE RUN: the entry point reduces to `prepare_erasure` + `visitExpr`
-- from the EMPTY state (R1); `prepare_erasure` is state-transparent with csimp off (R2),
-- which is what pins that state to `{}`; the non-recursive exit's stored body is found by
-- `envLookup` under `Γ.constants n` and really erases the body the run erased; the
-- recursive block's siblings are each found at their own index.
--
-- LEDGER: one trust item LEAVES. `PrepareHyps.prepare_sound` was a fourth, independent
-- field of the trust class; it is now the THEOREM `prepare_sound_of_prepareHyps`, derived
-- from the three per-transform fields along R2's monadic-bind decomposition. Nothing is
-- added: the residues (context-uniformity of a constant body's erasure, the applied form
-- of the stored body, the `Esrc`-domain agreement, and the recursive block's δ witness)
-- are explicit named premises of the walk step, not new bundles.
--
-- Expectation: the pure `EraseM`/`CoreM`/`LBTerm` layer is sorryAx-free (R1, R2, the
-- decomposition, the `Kername.beq` and `envLookup` kit, the recursive registration and
-- its guard); the two bridge-facing results carry exactly the lean4lean boundary
-- `erases_nonrec_const_body` already carried.

-- ============================================================================
-- The DAG cold-start wall, slice S4 (2026-08-12): the capstone's subject becomes
-- `Erasure.erase`.
--
-- THE STATEMENT. `Erasure.erase e cfg cctx ref w = .ok (p, inls) w'` from the EMPTY state
-- now yields `∃ E t t', p = .untyped E (some t) ∧ WcbvEval E appliedFlags t t' ∧ … ∧
-- (uniqueness)`. `E` and `t` are PRODUCED, not consumed. Discharged from the run: the
-- state (R1+R2 — csimp off makes `prepare_erasure` state-transparent, so the `visitExpr`
-- run really starts at `{}`), the environment, `ClosedEnv E`, `LBClosed t 0` (R11, no
-- hypotheses), the bridge invariant (CONSTRUCTED at `{}` by `gBridgeInv_nil`), and the
-- three registration records (from `RegInvShape`, modulo registration completeness).
--
-- A REFUTED PREMISE, RAISED NOT INHERITED. Slice S1d's `RegShapeHyps` is INCONSISTENT,
-- so its corollaries `visitExpr_regInvShape` / `visitMutual_regInvShape` /
-- `get_constant_kername_regInvShape` are vacuous. Two independent proofs land here:
--   * `regShapeHyps_fresh_refuted` — `fresh` quantifies over EVERY state satisfying the
--     invariant with no link to the call; at `addAxiomState n {}` (a state S1's own
--     `RegInvShape.addAxiom` produces) it asserts `Kername.beq (toKername n) (toKername n)
--     = false`;
--   * `regShapeHyps_recClosed_refuted` — `recClosed` asserts `LBClosed (.fix defs j) 0`
--     for EVERY block, including a one-definition block whose body is `.bvar 5`.
-- `regKeys`/`regCtors`/`regCases`/`regFields` fall the same way (the `register_inductive`
-- HIT run is constructible, so they can be instantiated at a hand-made empty-`gdecls`
-- state). The repair is stated at the refutation: a coverage field in `RegInvShape` (which
-- needs R4's `ConstExt` to record its axiom prefix's KEYS) plus a `RunClosed.rc` that
-- TAKES the block's closedness — both inside S1's files, but together a re-run of the
-- 18-motive shape induction, hence a slice of their own. Until then the capstone routes
-- the preservation through `RegBridgeHyps.regInv`, which is keyed on an actual run and so
-- sits in the epistemic class of `BridgeHyps` (no run of the family is constructible
-- in-logic): not decidable here, not refutable here.
--
-- [S1e, below] Both moving parts landed and the diagnosis was sharpened: coverage does not
-- restore key DISTINCTNESS, and nothing can — `runClosed_keysDistinct_refuted`. The
-- capstones now route the preservation through the THEOREM `visitExpr_regInvShape`, and
-- `RegBridgeHyps.regInv` is gone.
--
-- SCOPE, so it is not over-read. `BridgeInv.known_dom` says a `known` constant is ALREADY
-- registered; at `{}` nothing is, so `known = ⊥` and `Supported.const` is unusable. The
-- cold-start fragment therefore contains NO δ-constant, and `Esrc` is empty: the δ records
-- are discharged vacuously, not from the walk. Closing that needs bridge motive 5's miss
-- branch, which needs motive 6 to conclude an UNCONDITIONAL state/generator fact — and
-- motive 1's conclusion is entirely conditional, so it is a restructuring of
-- `visitExpr_refines_erases_core`, not a new `RegBridgeHyps` field as S2's note supposed.
--
-- Expectation: the two capstones' axiom sets are IDENTICAL to
-- `shipping_erase_correct_firstorder{,ι}_registered`'s — no axiom of ours, no movement.
-- The two refutations are pure `LBTerm`/state reasoning and are sorryAx-free.

-- ============================================================================
-- COLD-START SLICE S1e (2026-08-12): the refuted `RegShapeHyps` bundle, repaired.
--
-- Same expectation as S1/S1d: this layer is pure `LBTerm`/`EraseM`/`GlobalDeclarations`
-- reasoning — no `Erases`, no `TrExprS`, no lean4lean — so ⊆ [propext, Classical.choice,
-- Quot.sound] and NO `sorryAx`, tight rather than inherited. The two capstones'
-- sets must not move at all.
--
-- WHAT WAS WRONG, AND HOW FAR DOWN. S4 refuted two fields of S1d's `RegShapeHyps`. The
-- defect is one level deeper: with `keys : KeysDistinct s.gdecls` in `RegInvShape`, the
-- statement `RunClosed (RegInvShape Γ)` is ITSELF false, at every `Γ`. `RunClosed.nrc` is
-- a bare STATE closure — it is applied inside `run_nonrec_exit_ok` at whatever state the
-- body's erasure left behind, with no run in scope — so it must survive two conses at the
-- same name, which duplicate a key. `runClosed_keysDistinct_refuted` proves it in five
-- lines and needs no hypothesis on `Γ` at all. No repair of the HYPOTHESES existed.
--
-- THE REPAIR.
--   * `RegInvShape` trades `keys` for `cover : ConstKeysCovered s` — every `.constantDecl`
--     entry is filed under the canonical kername of a constant the registry knows. Every
--     registration site preserves it with NO side condition, which is why every freshness
--     premise disappears from the S1 step lemmas (`addAxiom`, `constCons`, `constExt`,
--     `registerInd`, `recConst` and the two `…_run` forms all lost theirs). What coverage
--     buys back is `RegInvShape.fresh_of_unregistered`: an unregistered name owns no
--     constant key — the freshness the design called `hkinj`, now DERIVED at the one guard
--     the code really tests (`get_constant_kername`'s miss branch), modulo injectivity of
--     `toKername`, which is a naming assumption and not a theorem.
--   * `Erasure.ConstExt` now records the KEYS of its axiom prefix, not just its shape —
--     without that, coverage cannot cross a `register_inductive` call, whose cold branch
--     emits one `addAxiom` per `@[extern]` constructor. This is R4's contribution to S1e.
--   * `RunClosed.rc` TAKES `∀ j, LBClosed (.fix defs j) 0`. `Erasure.run_rec_exit_ok` now
--     reports the shape of the block it is storing (`defs.length = names.length`, and per
--     definition "my body is a `mkDef` closure of a `Cl` erasure output over `fixnames`"),
--     from which `rec_block_closed` computes the closedness inside the induction.
--     S1d's `recClosed`, refuted at `.fix [{body := .bvar 5}] 0`, is gone.
--   * The premise record is now `RegBridgeHyps`, merging what survived of `RegShapeHyps`
--     (`knames`, `prep`, the three `Γ`-agreement fields) with S4's own bundle (`satCtors`,
--     `satCases`). S4's `regInv` field is the THEOREM `visitExpr_regInvShape`.
--   * The `Γ`-agreement fields are now guarded by the cold branch's own test
--     (`s.inductives.get? ii.name = none`). That guard is load-bearing, and S1e formalises
--     why: `Erasure.run_register_inductive_hit_mk` CONSTRUCTS a hit-branch run out of
--     `get`/`pure`, so `regShapeHyps_regCtors_refuted` instantiates S1d's unguarded field
--     at a hand-made state with empty `gdecls` — at a `Γ` that records a constructor, i.e.
--     at exactly the `Γ` the capstone is interesting at. Cold runs are not constructible
--     (their body reads the environment through `getConstInfo`), so the guarded field is
--     in the epistemic class of `BridgeHyps`.
--
-- WHAT THE INVARIANT NO LONGER CLAIMS. Key distinctness of `gdecls` is not an invariant of
-- the shipping walk, and `ColdStartDelta`'s `KeysDistinct` premises stay premises of their
-- callers. Two independent reasons, both recorded in code: the `nrc` refutation above, and
-- `addAxiom`'s panic fall-through (its "already defined" guard has no `return`, so a
-- second entry under the same key is consed). A third, orthogonal fact was found while
-- stating coverage: `mutualBlockKn_eq_toKername` — the block keys are INSIDE the constant
-- keys (`rootKername s` IS `toKername (.str .anonymous s)`), so for a root-level single
-- inductive `A` the block entry and an axiom entry for `A` collide, first-match-wins.
-- Whether that is reachable is a question about the shipping eraser (it needs a bare
-- inductive constant to pass the erasability gate into `visitMutual`), NOT about this
-- development; it is raised, not patched.
--
-- Expectation: no axiom of ours, no movement in the capstones, no `sorryAx` anywhere in
-- this block.
--
-- ONE MOVEMENT, AND ITS CAUSE. Six entries in the S1 block above gained
-- `Classical.choice`: `RegInvShape.registeredCtors`/`registeredCases`/
-- `registeredCtorFieldsAll`/`noFixEnv`/`closedEnv`/`inlinings`, all of which were
-- `[propext, Quot.sound]`. Nothing about them changed; the INVARIANT they project from
-- did. Its old `keys` field was `List.Pairwise` on kernames, which mentions no shipping
-- function, while `cover` mentions `Erasure.toKername` — and `toKername`, through
-- `cleanIdent`'s string walk, carries `Classical.choice`, exactly as every other
-- `toKername`-mentioning entry in the S1 block already did (`RegInvShape.empty`,
-- `addAxiom_run`, `nonrecConst`, …). Additions only, inside the allowed set, and no
-- `sorryAx` reach anywhere.

-- ============================================================================
-- δ-inclusion, slices D1-D3 (2026-08-12): the walk hands back the declaration it
-- fetched, the registration exits get world-indexed twins, and the δ SCOPE bundle
-- lands beside the three trust bundles.
--
-- THE WALL, RESTATED. A cold start begins at the empty state, so `BridgeInv.known_dom`
-- ("a `known` constant is already registered") is not merely strong there — it is FALSE
-- for every non-empty fragment (`old_known_dom_cold_refuted`, kept below). That is what
-- pinned every cold-start capstone to `known = ⊥`, and `Supported.const` needs `known n`,
-- so a cold-started program could not CALL anything. Slice D4a removes the wall.
--
-- WHAT LANDED.
--   * D1 — `run_visitMutual_decomp` now hands back the `getDeclInfo?` run itself (at the
--     `CoreM` layer), the `prepare_erasure` run, the dependency's reader context pinned to
--     `{ ctx with fixvars := none, lparams := ci.levelParams }`, and the entry-side
--     `InlineExt`. All four facts were already in the proof and were discarded; the
--     declaration is what every branch condition (`isExtern`, `getInlineAttribute?`,
--     `name_occurs`, `value?`) is a pure function of, so pinning it is what separates the
--     three disjuncts. Axiom set UNCHANGED (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).
--   * D2 — `run_{inline_tail,inline_prefix,nonrec_exit,rec_exit}_ok'`, the same four
--     registration rules over `P : ErasureState → Void IO.RealWorld → Prop` instead of
--     `Q : ErasureState → Prop`. Two forced differences: every state-transparent primitive
--     on the path (`logInfo`, `Meta.isInstance`, `mkFreshFVarId`, `getConstInfo`) advances
--     the world and so needs its own clause — free in the state-only form — and `hvE` is
--     keyed on the `prepare_erasure` run as well, so a caller can RE-ESTABLISH an
--     invariant at the erasure's entry state rather than merely propagate one. Pure
--     `EraseM` reasoning: all four are sorryAx-free.
--   * D3 — `DeltaHyps`, the scope-side half of the contract whose state-side half is
--     `BridgeInv`: fragment δ-closure (`esrc_sub`/`disj`), the decl-fetch/`Esrc` agreement
--     (`decl_run`), prepared dependency bodies `Supported` + translatable (`prepared`),
--     `axiom_free`, `nofixvars`, the five generator-bookkeeping clauses, and the `∀ Δ`
--     uniformity residue. Epistemic class: `BridgeHyps`/`RegBridgeHyps` — Hoare specs for
--     REAL calls (none of the primitives is in the `visitExpr` mutual block), never an
--     axiom, never a statement about a whole environment.
--
-- LEDGER: additions only, and no NEW kind of trust. `DeltaHyps` is a `Prop` bundle, so it
-- is a hypothesis, never an axiom; unlike `CasesBridgeHyps` it is `env`/`Us`-indexed
-- (`prepared` mentions `TrExprS`, `uniform` mentions `Erases`), so its TYPE carries
-- lean4lean's `sorryAx` exactly as `BridgeInv`'s does. Nothing moved: no existing entry's
-- axiom set changed, and `run_visitMutual_decomp` in particular is byte-identical in its
-- ledger row after the widening.
--
-- WHAT DID **NOT** LAND IN D3, AND WHY. The design's D3 also called for DELETING
-- `BridgeInv.known_dom` with the promise "green after this slice". That is not achievable
-- as a separate slice, and the two guards below are the proof:
--   * `old_known_dom_cold_refuted` — the field is refutable at the entry configuration,
--     so it does have to go (the design's diagnosis is right);
--   * `constants_get!_unregistered_ne` — but it is the ONLY thing forcing motive 5's hit
--     branch, and the miss branch returns `s'.constants[n]!`, i.e. `default`, which is not
--     `Γ.constants n`. Discharging the miss branch needs "`visitMutual n` registered `n`",
--     which inside `visitExpr.mutual_fixpoint_induct` can only come from motive 6 — before
--     D4a, `True`. Giving motive 6 content is a statement change to the crown theorem
--     (it must then take `DeltaHyps`, which is NOT vacuous at `known = ⊥` because of the
--     bookkeeping clauses, hence a new premise at every consumer). So the field's death
--     and motive 6's content are one atomic change — slice D4a, below.

-- δ-inclusion, slice D4a (2026-08-12): `BridgeInv.known_dom` is DELETED, `visitMutual`'s
-- motive gets content, and `get_constant_kername`'s miss branch closes. A cold-started
-- program may now CALL a constant.
--
-- WHAT LANDED, in one atomic change (the field's death and the motive's content are not
-- separable — see the D3 note above):
--   * `BridgeInv` loses `known_dom` (field + 4 transports + 7 vacuous construction sites);
--     the invariant no longer mentions `known` at all, and `bridgeInv_cold_known` shows it
--     is now SATISFIABLE at the entry configuration for a non-empty fragment — the exact
--     statement that was refutable before (`old_known_dom_cold_refuted`, kept).
--   * motive 6 (`visitMutual`) stops being `True`: under `BridgeInv` + `known n` a
--     successful call now concludes `RunConcl s s' ∧ gw w ≤ gw w' ∧ (s'.constants.get? n).isSome`
--     — the same CONDITIONAL shape motive 5 has. Step 6 is proved by walking the four
--     exits (`@[inline]` prefix, the two `addAxiom` exits, the non-recursive exit; the
--     recursive exit is refuted inside the fragment by `DeltaHyps.decl_run`'s
--     `name_occurs`), rebuilding `BridgeInv` field-by-field at the dependency's reader —
--     `withReader` moves only `fixvars` (matched by `DeltaHyps.nofixvars`) and `lparams`
--     (pinned at `Us` by `decl_run`) — and feeding motive 1's OWN IH with the fragment's
--     `Supported`/`TrExprS` (`DeltaHyps.prepared`).
--   * motive 5's miss branch is proved, not refuted: `hashMap_get!_of_get?` makes the
--     `panic!`-defaulting lookup total from the registration conclusion, and
--     `RunConcl.canon` makes it canonical at the POST-state (where `BridgeInv.consts` no
--     longer applies) — the same move `BridgeInv.mono_state` makes.
--   * `visitExpr_refines_erases{,_core}` take `DeltaHyps` (∀ `cctx`/`ref`, since those are
--     bound inside the conclusion), threaded opaquely through every consumer:
--     `erases_nonrec_const_body`, `shipping_visitExpr_correct{,'}`,
--     `shipping_visitExpr_correct_data`, `shipping_erase_correct_firstorder{,_registered}`,
--     `shipping_erase_correct_firstorderι{,_of_shape,_registered}`,
--     `erases_nonrec_const_registered`, `registeredClosureData_step_nonrec`, and the two
--     cold-start capstones.
--
-- TWO CLAUSES THE BUNDLE WAS SHORT, both forced by the point of use and both recorded at
-- their fields (this is a STRENGTHENING of a hypothesis, so it is stated, not buried):
--   * `prep_esrc` — `prepared` is keyed on `Esrc n = some pe` at the run's own output,
--     while `decl_run` only gives `(Esrc n).isSome`; the two cannot be joined in-logic
--     (one names *some* body, the other produces *its* body). `prep_esrc` states the
--     identification, keyed on the two runs a caller inside the induction holds. It is the
--     same fact `registeredClosureData_step_nonrec` takes as `hEsrc` at the composition
--     site; there is no composition site inside an induction.
--   * `prep_run` gains `s' = s`. `prepare_erasure`'s state transparency is PROVED for
--     csimp-off configurations (`run_prepare_erasure_state`), but the reader's config is
--     an induction variable and `BridgeInv` does not pin `csimp`, so the gate is invisible
--     at the point of use. Same classification as `Erasure.run_nonrec_exit_ok`'s `hprep`,
--     whose docstring already says so.
--
-- LEDGER: no new axiom, no `sorry`. Deleting an invariant field WEAKENS every theorem's
-- premise; adding two bundle clauses strengthens `DeltaHyps`, which is a `Prop` premise,
-- never an axiom. The bridge's own axiom row is unchanged.

-- δ-inclusion, slice D4b (2026-08-12): the δ RECORD travels the walk. Every bridge
-- motive's state conclusion is now `RunConclδ` — `Erasure.RunConcl` plus "the record
-- survived" — so the top-level run reports what the walk recorded, instead of the
-- capstone assuming it.
--
-- WHAT LANDED.
--   * `DeltaMem` — "every constant body the walk RECORDED for a fragment name erases the
--     source body `Esrc` records for it", membership-flavoured (S1e proved no state
--     predicate along the walk can maintain `KeysDistinct`, so `envLookup` cannot be the
--     carrier; the conversion happens once, at the end).
--   * `RunConclδ` — the bundle that made the threading cheap: `rc` + the record's
--     transport, produced and composed exactly where a `RunConcl` was, so the ~40
--     conclusion sites of the 18-motive induction did not have to change shape.
--   * step 6 extends the record at the non-recursive exit (the body it just erased, from
--     motive 1's own IH), and transports it across the axiom exits and the `@[inline]`
--     bookkeeping for free; step 3 and step 17 transport it across `register_inductive`
--     via `run_register_inductive_gdeclsConst` — every entry that call conses is an
--     `.inductiveDecl` or a value-less `.constantDecl ⟨none⟩`.
--   * `registeredClosure{,Data}_of_deltaMem` — the capstone-side conversion (membership
--     + `KeysDistinct` → `envLookup`). D5 wires it up; it is not wired here.
--
-- FOUR DESIGN CLAIMS THAT DID NOT SURVIVE CONTACT, all recorded at their definitions:
--   1. the record cannot be keyed on the registry DOMAIN (the design's shape). The domain
--      grows at `register_inductive`'s `@[extern]`-constructor `addAxiom` prefix, and
--      `run_register_inductive_cold_ok` exposes a `ConstExt`, not the per-name `addAxiom`
--      runs `DeltaHyps.axiom_free` would need. Keyed on the recorded ENTRY, the same call
--      transports for free — at the price of the existence half becoming a premise of the
--      conversion (`hreg`).
--   2. `NoBlock` cannot be part of the record: it is an output-shape statement, the shape
--      induction proves `NoFix`/`LBClosed` and not it, and inside the bridge the erasure
--      argument is abstract. It is a premise of the `Data` conversion.
--   3. `∀ Δ` cannot be part of the record either: the bridge fires at the `Δ` of the CALL
--      SITE (`visitMutual`'s `withReader` keeps the ambient `lctx`), so the record carries
--      `∃ Δ` and the conversion takes the `huni` residue this development already carries
--      everywhere else.
--   4. the extension step is FALSE without a naming assumption: `Erasure.toKername` is not
--      injective (`mutualBlockKn_eq_toKername`), so two names can share a `gdecls` key and
--      the record is then false for one of them. `DeltaHyps.kinj` restricts it to the
--      fragment — the fragment-scoped form of the capstone's `hkinj`.
--
-- LEDGER: no new axiom. `DeltaMem`/`RunConclδ` are `Prop`s over `Erases`, so their types
-- carry lean4lean's `sorryAx` exactly as `BridgeInv`'s do; the two `Erasure`-side lemmas
-- are pure `EraseM`/list reasoning and are sorryAx-free.

-- δ-inclusion, slice D5 (2026-08-12): the cold-start capstones are rewired for δ. A
-- cold-started program may now CALL a walked function, and the capstone PROVES the
-- environment fact that makes the target's δ step legal instead of assuming it.
--
-- WHAT LANDED.
--   * `known` and `Esrc` are PARAMETERS of both capstones. `gBridgeInv_nil` gained a
--     `known` argument (the invariant stopped mentioning `known` at D4a; this was the last
--     place the entry configuration pinned the fragment at `⊥`), and `ColdStartSubject`
--     gained a `known` index so the subject may reference constants.
--   * `ErasesEnvDeltaData` is DERIVED: the bridge's `RunConclδ` carries `DeltaMem.empty`
--     from the entry state to the run's final state, and
--     `registeredClosureData_of_deltaMem_walked` converts membership to `envLookup`.
--   * `SEnv.walked` — `Esrc` cut to the constants the final environment stores a BODY for,
--     keyed on `LBTerm.envLookup` (the target semantics' own δ-lookup). The capstones'
--     source-evaluation premise is stated at that restriction.
--   * `NoBlockEnv` + `ColdStartSubject.noBlockEnv`; `SEnvConsistent.walked`;
--     `DeltaHyps.uniform` generalised from `Δ = []` to two arbitrary contexts (`DeltaMem`
--     carries `∃ Δ`, the CALL SITE's, so nothing one-sided bridges it).
--   * The `Hδ` bundle's `Esrc` is SPLIT from the simulation's in every shipping theorem
--     (`Esrcδ`): the bundle's is the fragment (a scope), the simulation's is what the
--     evaluation δ-unfolds (the walk-restricted one). Conflating them forces either a false
--     record or a bundle at an environment `DeltaHyps.prep_esrc` cannot be stated at.
--
-- THE FOUR OPEN PREMISES OF THE D4b CONVERSION, RESOLVED:
--   * existence (`hreg`) — **DERIVED**. `SEnv.walked`'s defining condition *is* the lookup
--     the record needs. It does NOT fall to `RegInvShape.cover`, which states the converse
--     (every stored constant key is a name the registry knows), and it is not provable in
--     the unrestricted form at all: a fragment constant the program never mentions is never
--     registered, so unrestricted `ErasesEnvDeltaData` is FALSE, not merely unproved.
--   * key distinctness (`hkeys`/`hkinj`) — **ELIMINATED**. Keyed on `envLookup` rather than
--     on membership, the conversion never turns a membership into a lookup. This is one
--     premise better than the design predicted (it expected `hkinj` to be paid here).
--   * context-uniformity (`huni`) — **DISCHARGED at slice δ-D7b**. `DeltaHyps.uniform` is
--     deleted; the capstones call `ErasesUniform.erases_uniform_closed`. The context it
--     starts from comes with its own well-formedness and `NoBV` (δ-D7b(i)), both free at
--     the production site (`BridgeInv.vlctx_wf`/`BridgeInv.noBV`) and recoverable nowhere
--     else. What is left is ONE named VExpr-level premise, `ErasableStrengthen`.
--   * applied form (`hnb`) — **RETIRED at slice δ-N**, and the claim recorded here was
--     wrong. `NoBlock` is `True` on `.box` (boxing is invisible to it) and `False` on
--     exactly one node, `.construct _ _ (_ :: _)`; the eraser's single `.construct`
--     construction site is nullary by explicit design. So the shape induction DOES carry
--     it, as `ShapeC`'s third conjunct (`visitExpr_shape_all`), and at the environment
--     level `NoBlockEnv` is a `RunClosed` predicate (`runClosed_noBlockEnv`).
--     `ColdStartSubject.noBlock`/`.noBlockEnv` are both deleted; the record has one field.
--
-- LEDGER: no new axiom, no `sorry`. `SEnv.walked`/`NoBlockEnv` are plain definitions over
-- `GlobalDeclarations`; `envδ` is built with lean4lean's own `VEnv.addConst`/`addDefEq` and
-- its WF with `VDecl.WF.def`, so the δ guard's environment carries exactly what `envFO`'s
-- two-axiom environment carries. The capstones' axiom sets must be UNCHANGED.

-- δ-inclusion, slice D6 (2026-08-12): the recursive exit's `List.mapM`, walked.
--
-- `run_rec_exit_decomp` reports only `s₁ = recConstState fixnames defs sd`, with `defs` an
-- unconstrained existential — the per-definition runs sit under a `List.mapM` and were
-- discarded. `run_rec_exit_siblings` walks that loop with an EXISTENTIALLY-LOADED
-- invariant (`run_list_mapM_ok` at a `P` that keeps the runs, not their consequences), and
-- hands back per sibling: the fetched declaration, the `prepare_erasure` and `visitExpr`
-- runs at the block's own reader, and `mkDef`'s closing equation. Pure `EraseM` reasoning,
-- so it must be sorryAx-free; `run_rec_exit_siblings_closed` adds the two output-shape
-- facts (`NoFix`/`LBClosed` of each OPEN body) that no state predicate could carry, since
-- those bodies never appear in a state.
--
-- WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT UNBLOCK. Against `EnvErasureRec.erases_fix_of_open`'s
-- premise list, D6 supplies `hoclosed`, `hclose` and the length premises from the run, and
-- the per-sibling `visitExpr` runs that `hopen` needs. It does NOT supply:
--   * `hnd : ids.Nodup` — freshness, i.e. `BridgeHyps.fresh_run`; the loop rule here is
--     deliberately `gw`-free;
--   * `hreg` — "`Γ.recBodies` names the block THIS run built". Irreducible at a parameter
--     `Γ`: `Γ` is fixed before the run. This is the run-keyed agreement that should replace
--     `RegisteredClosureRec`, and it is a strictly weaker, strictly more checkable
--     assumption than an `Erases` witness;
--   * `hopen` itself — each per-sibling erasure is at `Γ.withFixvars fv`, under the run's
--     block-local fixvar map, which is the `Γ`-inside-the-motives generalisation (D8).
-- So `RegisteredClosureRec` is NOT demoted here; the gap behind it is documented
-- premise-by-premise in `ColdStartDelta`'s recursion section and at the record itself.

-- COMPOSITION COHERENCE PASS (2026-08-13): the three walls, composed.
--
-- SUPERSEDED 2026-08-26 by the closing section of this file. Kept verbatim, because it is
-- the record of what the three walls measured on the day they composed. Two of its claims
-- have since moved and are corrected there, not here: the job/entry counts, and "R residue
-- — three, and only three" (there is now ONE, `ErasableStrengthen`; the other two were
-- retired and demoted by the δ-residue wave below).
--
-- The recursion wall (W0.1–W3.1), the Nat-literals wall (L1–L4) and the DAG cold-start
-- wall with δ-inclusion (S1–S4, D1–D6) landed as ~20 independent slices. This section
-- records what the COMPOSITION measures, so the three are audited as one artifact rather
-- than three.
--
-- MEASURED AT `cef1eb8` + this pass, from clean: `lake build` = 162 jobs, green; this
-- file = 510 `#print axioms` entries, of which 17 report NO axiom at all (the tight
-- pure-`LBTerm` layers) and 493 report a set.
--
-- THE FOUR CROWN THEOREMS PRINT ONE SET, VERBATIM AND IDENTICAL:
--
--   shipping_erase_correct_firstorder
--   shipping_erase_correct_firstorderι
--   shipping_erase_correct_firstorder_coldstart
--   shipping_erase_correct_firstorderι_coldstart
--
--     [propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound,
--      Lean.Expr.instantiate1_eq, Lean.PersistentArray.toList'_push,
--      Lean.PersistentHashMap.WF.find?_eq, Lean.PersistentHashMap.WF.toList'_insert]
--
-- Three standard Lean axioms, `sorryAx` (inherited through lean4lean's `TrExprS`
-- structural lemmas, whose `proj` case calls the sorried `TrProj`), and four lean4lean
-- `Lean.Expr`/`PersistentHashMap` MODELLING axioms.
--     [CORRECTED 2026-08-27 at the `fee3ada` re-pin. The SET above is still exactly what
--      the four crown theorems print — verbatim, unmoved. The PARENTHETICAL is now false:
--      the `TrExprS` structural lemmas (`weakFV'`, `weakBV`, `mono`, `instN`) are all
--      sorryAx-FREE at `fee3ada`, and `TrProj` is no longer sorried. The `sorryAx` these
--      four still carry comes from UNIQUE TYPING — `TrExprS.uniq` → `TrProj.uniq`
--      (`PROJ-TODO`), and `IsDefEq.uniqU`, itself sorried through `IsDefEqU.weakN_iff`
--      (= C1, not discharged) and the ι fork's `pat` cases. See the re-pin section in this
--      file's header docstring for the measurement.]
-- NO AXIOM OF OURS ANYWHERE, and — the
-- point of measuring it at the composition rather than per slice — the cold-start pair
-- prints exactly what the warm pair prints. Moving the subject from an abstract
-- `visitExpr` run under a registered state to `Erasure.erase` from the EMPTY state, and
-- widening the fragment from δ-free to δ-included, cost nothing in axioms. Everything
-- those two slices added is a `Prop` premise or a derivation.
--
-- THE TRUST LEDGER lives in code, at `ColdStart.lean`'s module docstring ("THE TRUST
-- LEDGER — every premise of the two cold-start capstones, classified"), beside the D3ι
-- ledger in `FirstOrderShippingIota.lean`. It classifies EVERY premise of the two
-- cold-start capstones into four classes and nothing falls outside them:
--
--   C  proved-guard-backed certificate — `rfl`/`decide`-checkable data at a concrete
--      `Γ`/`env`, constructed in the guards: `henv`, `hnat`, `hiacoh`, `hcc`,
--      `RegBridgeHyps.knames`, `hfo` (modulo `harity`), and `hcon` at the δ guard.
--   H  runtime Hoare bundle — a spec for one REAL call on an opaque `ST`/`EIO`
--      primitive: `BridgeHyps`, `DataBridgeHyps`, `CasesBridgeHyps`, the bookkeeping
--      half of `DeltaHyps`, `RegBridgeHyps`' cold-`register_inductive` fields,
--      `PrepareHyps` (three fields — `prepare_sound` is now the THEOREM
--      `prepare_sound_of_prepareHyps`), and `IotaConsistent`. Not an axiom; not in-logic
--      decidable. The documented boundary.
--   S  scope restriction — `Us = []`, `cfg.csimp = false`, `Γ.fixvars = ⊥`,
--      `Γ.recBodies = ⊥`, `IotaRelevant`, the fragment clauses of `DeltaHyps`,
--      `ColdStartSubject.supported`, `hev`, `hfo`. A violation makes the PREMISE
--      unsatisfiable, never the theorem false.
--   R  residue — three, and only three: `RegisteredClosureRec` (the recursive δ witness;
--      what `Γ.recBodies = ⊥` stands in for, gap narrowed by D6 to `hnd`/`hreg`/`hopen`
--      at the block-local `Γ`, i.e. §W3.2/D8), `DeltaHyps.uniform` (the `∀ Δ`
--      context-uniformity, a lean4lean-side `TrExprS`-weakening obligation), and
--      `ColdStartSubject.noBlock`/`noBlockEnv` (applied form of the output and of every
--      recorded body — provably not carryable by the shape induction or by a bridge
--      motive; see slice D5's four-premise resolution above).
--
-- The run itself (`hrun`) sits outside all four: no successful run of the erasure family
-- is constructible in-logic, which is why every guard in this development leaves it
-- hypothetical.
--
-- ONE DEAD HYPOTHESIS REMOVED IN THIS PASS. `DeltaHyps.decl_run`'s fourth conjunct
-- `(Esrc n).isSome` was superseded at slice D4a by `prep_esrc` (which identifies THIS
-- run's prepared body rather than naming some body) and was projected by no consumer —
-- the single use site takes only `name_occurs n v = false`. Dropping it WEAKENS the
-- bundle, so no consumer moves and no axiom set moves.
-- ============================================================================

-- The composition, re-measured in one place: the four crown theorems must print the one
-- set quoted above, and the two derivations the ledger calls out must be theorems — both
-- are `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, i.e. sorryAx-FREE, which is the sharper
-- statement: what used to be a trust field is now proved without even inheriting the
-- lean4lean boundary.

-- WAVE δ-{D7a, N, rec, D7b(i)} — the three residues, revisited
--
-- 1. RESIDUE 3 (`ColdStartSubject.noBlock`/`.noBlockEnv`) — RETIRED, not discharged:
--    it was never a residue. See the corrected note above. `ShapeC` gains a third
--    output conjunct; `RunClosed.nrc`/`.rc` gain the matching slot; the two run-exit
--    lemmas are abstract in `Nf`/`Cl` and needed no change at all.
--
-- 2. RESIDUE 2 (`DeltaHyps.uniform`) — the weakening half is now a theorem with NO
--    residue (`erases_weakFV`, `erases_weak_any`). The ledger blamed the wrong side:
--    `TrExprS.weakFV` has been proved upstream all along; what is missing is
--    `Erasable`/`HasType` STRENGTHENING, which is the commissioned obligation.
--    Correction to the design: lean4lean's `weakFV` wants `VLCtx.WF` of the target
--    context, and the `lam`/`letE` cases cannot re-establish it (`Erases.lam` carries no
--    `IsType` for its binder type). `VLCtx.FVWF` is all the proof consumes and conses
--    freely under a bvar entry — hence the `_fvwf` transcriptions. For the unrestricted
--    `∀ Δf` that `Erases.fix` demands, even `FVWF` is unavailable; there the
--    fvar-FREENESS of the source removes the hypothesis outright (no `.inr` lookup ever
--    happens), hence the `_nofvars` transcriptions and `erases_weak_any`.
--
-- 3. `erases_fix_of_open` — its `hopen` premise was UNSATISFIABLE for every
--    self-referential block, and unguarded. `Erases.fixvar` is the only rule with source
--    `.const` and target `.fvar`, and its `hfresh` is anti-monotone in `Δ`. Repaired by
--    conditioning `hopen` on a fresh `Δf` and rebuilding `Erases.fix`'s unrestricted
--    `hbodies` through `[]` with `erases_weak_any`. `gErases_fix_of_open` is the guard
--    it never had.
--
-- AXIOM MOVEMENT: none at the capstones. The new NoBlock lemmas are sorryAx-FREE (they
-- touch no lean4lean witness). The `Erases`-transport lemmas inherit `sorryAx` through
-- lean4lean's `TrProj.weak'`, which is the boundary the capstones already measure, and
-- the fragment excludes `.proj` anyway.
--     [CORRECTED 2026-08-27 at `fee3ada`. `TrProj.weak'` came back PROVED (A3), so it is
--      no longer a boundary at all, and the `Erases`-transport lemmas below —
--      `TrExprS.weakFV_fvwf`, `erases_weakFV`, `TrExprS.weakFV_nofvars`,
--      `erases_weak_any`, `erases_fix_of_open`, `gErases_fix_of_open`,
--      `BridgeInv.vlctx_wf`, `BridgeInv.noBV` — are all sorryAx-FREE now. The only
--      downstream cost of A0 was passing `henv` at the two `proj` arms in
--      `ErasesStrengthen.lean`, since `TrProj.weak'` gained an `Ordered env` premise.]

-- WAVE δ-D7b — context-uniformity, discharged
--
-- `DeltaHyps.uniform` is GONE. The two-sided transport it asserted is now
-- `ErasesUniform.erases_uniform_closed` = strengthen-to-`[]` then `erases_weak_any`.
--
-- What survives is exactly ONE named obligation, `ErasableStrengthen`: `HasType.weakN_inv`
-- for the shipping `VEnv.HasType`. Two upstream facts established while proving this, both
-- worth recording because they contradict the design pass:
--   * lean4lean does NOT prove `HasType.weakN_inv` for the stratified theories — those
--     statements sit inside comment blocks whose supporting `IsDefEq.weakN_inv` has `sorry`
--     arms;
--   * for the shipping `VEnv.HasType` the corresponding `IsDefEqU.weakN_iff`
--     (`Theory/Typing/UniqueTyping.lean`) is itself a `sorry`.
-- So discharging it from what upstream has today would import a gap, not close one.
--
-- The `box` arm DID close, and without a second obligation, via lean4lean's
-- `TrExprS.unique` — which is `sorry`-free but gated on `TrExprS.IsUnique e`
-- (projection-free). `NoProj` is that gate, and `DeltaHyps.esrc_shape` is where the
-- fragment pays it; the supported fragment excludes `.proj` anyway.
--
-- AXIOM MOVEMENT: none at the capstones. Everything mentioning `Erases` carries `sorryAx`
-- already — `TrProj` is a `sorry`-valued DEFINITION upstream and `Erases.box`/`lam`/`letE`
-- mention `TrExprS`, so `#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.Erases` has carried it from the
-- start.
--     [CORRECTED 2026-08-27 at `fee3ada`, and this is the annotation the re-pin most
--      directly overturns. That mechanism is DEAD: A1 replaced the `sorry`-valued `def`
--      with a real one, `#print axioms Lean4Lean.TrProj` is `[propext]`, and mentioning
--      `Erases`/`TrExprS` now costs nothing. It is what retired 111 declarations in this
--      file at a stroke — including `visitExpr_refines_erases` itself. Of the entries
--      listed just below, `Erases.strengthen_fvlift` and `erases_uniform_of_nil` went
--      clean; `erases_strengthen_closed` and `erases_uniform_closed` did NOT, because they
--      genuinely consume `.uniq`. `ErasableStrengthen` was `[propext]` before and after —
--      it is a Prop, never an axiom, and C1 not landing does not change that.]

-- WAVE δ-D8 — the bridge goes inside the block, and `RegisteredClosureRec` is demoted
--
-- THE EXPERIMENT AND ITS RESULT. `visitExpr_refines_erases` binds `Γ` as a plain implicit
-- and `VisitExprRefines.lean` contains no `variable` command at all, so the theorem is
-- Γ-polymorphic AS A STATEMENT and every application picks its own `Γ`. Instantiating it
-- at the block-local `Γ' := Γ.withFixvars fv` — the reader `visitMutual` installs while
-- erasing a mutual block — therefore needs NO motive change. Of its premises, EXACTLY ONE
-- breaks, as the design predicted:
--
--   BridgeHyps / DataBridgeHyps / CasesBridgeHyps  read only `Γ.ctors`, `Γ.casesOns`,
--     `Γ.ctorArities`, `Γ.casesDiscrPos`, `Γ.ctorFields` — every one `rfl` at
--     `withFixvars`. The three transports are field-by-field, zero obligations.
--   BridgeInv  rebuilt by `BridgeInv.withFixvars`: six fields are literally `Γ`'s or never
--     mentioned `Γ`; the two fixvar fields become the reader-vs-`fv` agreement (which the
--     `withReader` establishes by construction) and the block freshness (`fresh_run`
--     against `BridgeInv.reserved`). `known` is unconstrained — the invariant has not
--     mentioned it since D4a retired `known_dom`, which is precisely what lets the block's
--     inner runs be taken at `known = ⊥`.
--   Supported  transports and GROWS: `Supported.const`'s `known n ∨ Γ.fixvars n ≠ none`
--     gains the whole block as its second disjunct.
--   TrExprS witness, env.Ordered  never mentioned `Γ`.
--   DeltaHyps  THE ONE BREAK. `nofixvars` asserted `Γ.fixvars = ⊥` unconditionally, which
--     is FALSE at a block-local `Γ` (`gNofixvars_blocklocal_refuted`). It is now
--     conditioned on the fragment, `∀ {n}, known n → …`, which is all its two consumption
--     sites (both under `hkn : known n`) ever had in scope. `of_bot` loses its `hnfv`
--     argument — the tell that the field did nothing at `known = ⊥`.
--
-- WHAT THAT BUYS. `RegisteredClosureRec` stops being a certificate:
-- `erases_rec_block_of_run` derives its `erase` field from D6's per-sibling runs plus the
-- instantiated bridge plus `erases_fix_of_open_nil`, and `recEnvConsistent_of_block`
-- derives `RecEnvConsistent` outright. What survives is a REGISTRATION AGREEMENT —
-- `hreg`/`hfv`/`hcov`, "the `Γ` you supply names this block, under the map the run
-- installed" — irreducible at a parameter `Γ` and of `BridgeInv.knames` class, plus the
-- standing `hnest` residue. Scope cost, named: a block's bodies call only its own
-- siblings, registered constructors and registered `casesOn`s.
--
-- ALSO: `erases_fix_of_open_nil`. Slice `rec` conditioned `hopen` on a fresh `Δf`, but the
-- proof instantiates it at `Δf := []` and NOWHERE else, so the `∀ Δf` is not load-bearing.
-- The `[]`-only form is the one a run can supply; `erases_fix_of_open` is now its
-- corollary, signature verbatim.
--
-- THE CLAIM THAT FAILED, and it is not in the Γ-instantiation. The design expected the
-- capstones' `hnorec : Γ.recBodies = ⊥` to trade for the run-keyed agreement. It cannot,
-- yet, and the obstruction is upstream of everything above: `DeltaHyps.decl_run` demands
-- `name_occurs n v = false` of every fragment name, which forces `visitMutual`'s
-- `nonrecursive` test `true`, so the bridge's step 6 REFUTES the recursive exit instead of
-- walking it. A cold start never takes that exit inside the fragment, so there is no run
-- for these theorems to consume there. Wiring them in means giving step 6 a recursive
-- branch — `RunConclδ`'s `δ` transport across `recConstState` (which IS
-- `erases_rec_block_of_run`'s conclusion, so it composes), the block loop's generator
-- bookkeeping, and one more scope restriction, since the registration is keyed on
-- `remove_unsafe_rec n` and not on `n`.
--     [δ-D8e: this diagnosis is CORRECT ABOUT THE GATE and INCOMPLETE ABOUT THE REST.
--      The wiring list above omits a structural item that no premise supplies. See the
--      δ-D8e section at the end of this file.]
--
-- AXIOM MOVEMENT: none at the capstones, verbatim. The transports are pure record
-- surgery, and two of them (`DataBridgeHyps`, `CasesBridgeHyps`) come out sorryAx-FREE
-- along with `supported_const_fixOpen_not_ambient` and the two `nofixvars` guards; the
-- other two mention `TrExprS`, and the composition mentions `Erases`, so both inherit the
-- same lean4lean `TrProj` boundary those types have carried from the start.
--     [CORRECTED 2026-08-27 at `fee3ada`: the other two now come out sorryAx-FREE as well.
--      `BridgeHyps.withFixvars`, `BridgeInv.withFixvars` and `visitExpr_refines_erases_block`
--      all measure clean, because "mentions `TrExprS`/`Erases`" stopped implying anything
--      once `TrProj` got a definition. The entire δ-D8 slice is now sorryAx-free.]

-- ============================================================================
-- SLICE δ-D8e — the recursion trade, priced; and one premise that stops being one
--
-- The slice set out to walk the recursive exit and retire `hnorec` from both cold-start
-- capstones. It lands two of the four steps and PRICES the other two, because the price
-- turned out to be a motive change rather than a premise.
--
-- (1) THE `decl_run` RELAXATION — landed. The clause `name_occurs n v = false` was the
--     fifth conjunct of a spec about `Compiler.LCNF.getDeclInfo?`, and it is not about
--     the fetch at all. It is now `DeltaHyps.nonrecursive`, its own field, keyed on the
--     two runs its consumer holds (the fetch, which ties the value to the name, and the
--     `value?` hit) in `prep_esrc`'s style. `decl_run` is left with what the fetch
--     answers; `nonrecursive` is scope restriction 5, listed with the other four. The
--     trade is now a one-field trade. `of_bot` absorbs the new field for free — it is
--     keyed on `known n`.
--
-- (2) `hffv` — landed, and NOT where D8 filed it. D8 asked for a fourth `ShapeC`
--     conjunct, `FVarsIn (fun _ => False)` on `visitExpr`'s outputs. That is FALSE:
--     inside a block `visitConst` returns `.fvar x` for a sibling, and the repo's own
--     fixture has `gObodyD8 x = λa. x #0`. Fvar-freeness is a property of the STORED
--     body, after `mkDef` closes — and it is not an independent property even there. It
--     is a consequence of the block-local erasure plus the closing:
--       `erases_target_fvars`   an fvar-free SOURCE erases to a target whose free
--                               variables are all fixvars of `Γ` (the `Erases.fvar` rule
--                               is the only one that could invent one, and the source-side
--                               hypothesis kills it; `const_fix`/`fix` are killed by their
--                               own `htobv`),
--       `not_hasFVar_closeFix`  a term whose fvars lie in `ids` closes to one with none,
--                               on top of `hasFVar_toBvar` — `toBvar y` deletes exactly
--                               `y` and manufactures nothing.
--     So `erases_rec_block_of_run` DROPS `hffv` from its signature and derives it. Net:
--     one fewer premise on the δ-D8b theorem, and the shape induction is untouched.
--
-- (3) STEP 6's RECURSIVE BRANCH — NOT landed, and the reason is structural, which is the
--     correction to δ-D8's ledger entry. Removing `nonrecursive` lets the run REACH the
--     recursive exit; it does not let the bridge WALK it.
--
--     Inside `visitExpr_refines_erases_core` the exit's per-sibling erasures are runs of
--     the induction's ABSTRACT fixpoint argument, so the only thing available about them
--     is the motives — and the motives fix one `Γ`. The exit erases each sibling under
--     the reader carrying the block's fixvar map, while `BridgeInv.fixvars` is an IFF
--     against `Γ.fixvars`, which `DeltaHyps.nofixvars` pins at `⊥` for a fragment name —
--     and step 6 has `hkn : known n` in scope. So the erasure IH's own premise is FALSE
--     at the configuration the branch would have to run it in:
--       `bridgeInv_blockReader_refuted`        (any reader map with a hit),
--       `bridgeInv_rec_exit_reader_refuted`    (the block reader itself, one sibling).
--     δ-D8a's finding stands and is about the THEOREM: `visitExpr_refines_erases` is
--     Γ-polymorphic as a statement, which is what `visitExpr_refines_erases_block` reads
--     it at a second `Γ` from. Step 6 has no outside to read it from.
--
--     PRICED, in order: quantify `(known, Γ, Esrc)` and the four trust bundles inside all
--     eighteen motives (~40 IH sites, ~30 bundle uses); a block-loop decomposition that
--     CHAINS states and worlds, since `run_rec_exit_siblings` is `gw`-free by design and
--     hands its per-sibling runs back at unrelated states — exactly what a `BridgeInv`
--     cannot be rebuilt from; the transport of the OUTER δ record across the block's
--     inner runs; the block-local `Supported`/`TrExprS`/`Esrc` premises for the sibling
--     bodies, which the `known = ⊥` bundle cannot supply because every scope field of it
--     is keyed on `known n`; and the `remove_unsafe_rec` restriction, which is real:
--       `rec_exit_registers_stripped_name` — the exit registers under
--       `names.map remove_unsafe_rec`, so at `f._unsafe_rec` motive 6's
--       `(s'.constants.get? n).isSome` is FALSE on the run, not merely unproved.
--
-- (4) THE CAPSTONE TRADE — NOT landed, and deliberately. Taking `hcov` (a membership
--     agreement) in place of `hnorec` would LOOK like a widening and would not be one: the
--     only exit that cons a `.constantDecl ⟨some (.fix …)⟩` is the recursive one, and the
--     non-recursive exit provably cannot (`nonrec_exit_stores_no_fix`: it stores a
--     `visitExpr` output, and those are `NoFix`). With no producer, the membership premise
--     is uninhabited for every `n` with `Γ.recBodies n ≠ none`, so the traded capstone
--     would speak about exactly the same programs while hiding the restriction inside a
--     premise instead of naming it in the ledger. It waits for (3).
--
-- AXIOM MOVEMENT: none at the capstones, verbatim, again — same eight, third slice
-- running. The three pure-`LBTerm` fvar lemmas are sorryAx-FREE (`propext`, `Quot.sound`),
-- and so are `rec_exit_registers_stripped_name` and `nonrec_exit_stores_no_fix`. The two
-- `BridgeInv` refutations are NOT, and not for their own sakes: `BridgeInv.mlc` carries an
-- `MLCtx.WF`, hence `TrExprS`, hence the lean4lean `TrProj` boundary — the same one
-- `erases_target_fvars` inherits through `Erases`. Nothing new is trusted either way; a
-- refutation that inherits a boundary is still a refutation.
--     [CORRECTED 2026-08-27 at `fee3ada`: there is no longer a boundary to inherit. Both
--      `BridgeInv` refutations and `erases_target_fvars` are sorryAx-FREE now — the
--      `TrProj`-through-`TrExprS` channel they described was the definitional taint, and
--      A1 closed it. The refutations are unconditional.]

--
-- WHAT MOVED IN THE LEDGER, and it is the whole point of the week: class R went from
-- THREE to ONE.
--
--   R (was) `RegisteredClosureRec`      -> DEMOTED (δ-D8). Never a capstone premise;
--                                          `hnorec` (class S) always stood in for it. Its
--                                          `erase` field is derived
--                                          (`erases_rec_block_of_run`); a registration
--                                          agreement survives.
--   R (was) `DeltaHyps.uniform`         -> DISCHARGED (δ-D7b). The field is DELETED. What
--                                          replaces it is ONE commissioned `VExpr`-level
--                                          obligation, `ErasableStrengthen`, carried as an
--                                          explicit capstone premise `hstr`.
--   R (was) `ColdStartSubject.noBlock`  -> RETIRED (δ-N). It was never a residue: `NoBlock`
--           `.noBlockEnv`                 is `ShapeC`'s third conjunct and `NoBlockEnv` is
--                                          a `RunClosed` predicate. `ColdStartSubject` is
--                                          down to ONE field.
--   R (now) `ErasableStrengthen`        -> the only one. Commissioned upstream, not
--                                          assumed: `../lean4lean/trproj-commission.md`
--                                          Cluster 2. Its PROOF disjunct is ~5 lines once
--                                          `IsDefEqU.weakN_iff`'s forward direction lands;
--                                          the `IsArityUpTo` disjunct (forallE inversion
--                                          through a lift) is the real frontier.
--
-- TWO REFUTATIONS PRICE THE ONE THING THE WEEK DID NOT LAND. `hnorec` is still class S,
-- and δ-D8e established WHY in machine-checked form rather than by estimate:
-- `bridgeInv_blockReader_refuted` / `bridgeInv_rec_exit_reader_refuted` show the erasure
-- IH's own premise is FALSE at the block's reader, so the Γ-inside-the-motives
-- generalisation is necessary INSIDE the induction even though δ-D8 correctly found it
-- unnecessary for the bridge theorem as a STATEMENT. `nonrec_exit_stores_no_fix` shows the
-- capstone half cannot be landed ahead of that producer without replacing a named scope
-- restriction by an uninhabited premise. Both are in the ledger, priced.
--
-- ONE SHIPPING FINDING RAISED, NOT PATCHED, and it came from running the eraser rather
-- than from proving about it: `VerifyBench/STATUS.md`'s sparse-`casesOn` panic
-- (`notes/EQUIV_FINDINGS.md` D12). It is findings D4/D5 firing on real benchmark code —
-- `visitCases` reads the inductive off `casesInfo.declName.getPrefix` instead of
-- `casesInfo.indName`, the `unreachable!` returns `default : LBTerm = .box` (finding D7),
-- and `Quicksort` erases to a program that returns box on every non-empty list, exit 0,
-- well-formed `.ast`. Shipping code, left byte-unchanged.

-- RE-PIN 2026-08-27: lean4lean `1a1ebe8` (iota) -> `fee3ada` (trproj)
--
-- SUPERSEDES the 2026-08-26 composition section above ONLY on axiom provenance. Its
-- ledger movements (R three -> one) stand unchanged; its crown-four SET stands unchanged;
-- its explanation of WHY that set contains `sorryAx` does not. Every annotation in this
-- file that blamed `TrProj` now carries a bracketed correction in place, and the header
-- docstring carries the full measurement.
--
-- MEASURED AT this commit, from clean:
--   `lake build`             = 167 jobs, green (was 163; the four new jobs are lean4lean's,
--                              from master's `Verify/Level`, `NormLt`, `QSort`,
--                              `Theory/LevelSat`, which the merge brings along).
--   `lake build VerifyBench` = 172 jobs, green (was 168).
--   this file                = 596 `#print axioms` entries (584 + the 12 below), of which
--                              19 report NO axiom at all and 577 report a set.
--
-- WHAT THE RE-PIN COST IN CODE: two tokens. `TrProj.weak'` gained an `Ordered env`
-- premise (A3), so the two downstream re-proofs of lean4lean's `TrExprS.weakFV'` on weaker
-- premises pass `henv` at their `proj` arms (`ErasesStrengthen.lean`, both already had it
-- in scope). One further straggler the migration survey did not predict: master's new
-- `VExpr` kit for the `TrProj` proofs introduced `Lean4Lean.VExpr.mkApps_concat`, which
-- collided by name with the identical snoc lemma `IotaPattern.lean` had been carrying;
-- the local copy is deleted and the use site resolves upstream.
--
-- WHAT IT COST IN AXIOMS: two, and neither from the commissioned work.
-- `trproj` is a MERGE OF MASTER, and master added `Std.TreeMap.all_eq_all_toList` to
-- `Verify/Axioms.lean` and made `Lean.Level.isExplicitSubsumedAux_eq` reachable. They land
-- on the executable kernel-checker cluster and nowhere else — three entries:
-- `TypeChecker.kernel_isErasable_sound`, `ResidualHyps.toBridgeHyps`,
-- `shipping_visitExpr_correct'`. The commissioned two commits add no `axiom` at all.
--
-- WHAT IT BOUGHT: 139 entries (111 distinct declarations) lost `sorryAx` outright.
-- Entries carrying `sorryAx`: 230 -> 91. The mechanism is one line —
-- `#print axioms Lean4Lean.TrProj` is now `[propext]`, where it used to be a
-- `sorry`-valued DEFINITION, and a `sorry` in a definition taints the TYPE of every
-- statement mentioning `TrExprS`, proof or no proof.
--
-- THE LINE WORTH QUOTING: **`visitExpr_refines_erases` is sorryAx-free.** The claim that
-- the shipping eraser refines the `Erases` relation no longer rests on any lean4lean gap;
-- it rests only on the `Expr`/`PersistentHashMap` modelling axioms. Same for its `_core`
-- and `_block` forms, for `BridgeInv` and every transport of it, for `DeltaHyps`/
-- `DeltaMem`/`RunConclδ`/`ColdStartSubject`, for the whole δ registration chain, and for
-- every `Erases` transport and inversion lemma.
--
-- WHAT DID NOT MOVE, AND WHY THE CAPSTONES DID NOT: the forward-simulation half consumes
-- UNIQUE TYPING, which the trproj round did not close and was not asked to. `TrExprS.uniq`
-- (69 downstream call sites, 31 in `ErasesCorrectData.lean`) bottoms out in `TrProj.uniq`,
-- still `PROJ-TODO`; `IsDefEq.uniqU` bottoms out in `IsDefEqU.weakN_iff`, which is
-- commission item C1 — NOT discharged, and the delivered analysis argues it cannot be
-- discharged from what upstream has today (module import cycle: `ChurchRosser.lean`
-- imports `UniqueTyping.lean`; plus a same-measure logical cycle). `ErasableStrengthen`
-- therefore stays a named premise, exactly as the 2026-08-26 ledger has it.
--
-- THE TWO PROJ-TODOs THAT DO NOT REACH US: `TrProj.weak'_inv` (nothing here calls
-- `TrExprS.weakFV'_inv` — the `ErasesUniform` design routed around it, and that decision
-- pays off again here) and `TrEnv.proj_defeq` (a real STATEMENT with a deferred proof; a
-- new interface, deliberately not yet consumed).

-- n) <|> env.find? n` (`Lean/Compiler/LCNF/ToDecl.lean`) — the unsafe-recursive version is
-- tried FIRST. Measured on the §H benchmarks' arithmetic, at this toolchain:
--
--   Nat.add / Nat.mul / Nat.sub / Nat.pow / Nat.ble / Nat.beq
--   List.length / List.append / List.map / List.foldl
--       getDeclInfo? ↦ ci.name = `n._unsafe_rec`,  ci.all = [n._unsafe_rec],
--       name_occurs n ci.value! = true  ⟹  `nonrecursive` FALSE, the exit IS taken
--   Nat.div / Nat.mod / Nat.decEq / Nat.repr / List.reverse
--       no `._unsafe_rec` in the environment; ci.all = [n]; the non-recursive exit
--
-- Two consequences, in opposite directions:
--
--  (a) `BlockHyps.stripped : known n → remove_unsafe_rec n = n` is NOT the problem the
--      design feared. `n` there is `visitMutual`'s ARGUMENT — the name the source
--      mentions, `Nat.add` — and `remove_unsafe_rec Nat.add = Nat.add`. The `._unsafe_rec`
--      names appear only inside `ci.all`, and registration is under
--      `ci.all.map remove_unsafe_rec = [Nat.add]`, which is exactly what motive 6's
--      registration conclusion asks for. Measured end-to-end: `VerifyBench/ast/Arith.ast`
--      contains four `tFix` and ZERO occurrences of `_unsafe_rec`.
--
--  (b) `DeltaHyps.decl_run`'s `ci.all = [n]` conjunct is FALSE at exactly those names —
--      it is `[n._unsafe_rec]`. So the fragment `known` cannot contain `Nat.add` as the
--      bundle stands, and the benchmark payoff needs that conjunct relaxed to
--      `∃ m, ci.all = [m] ∧ remove_unsafe_rec m = n` (the `single_decl` test the run
--      actually performs is `ci.all.length == 1`, which holds). Likewise the block-local
--      scope fields the design keys on `known m` for `m ∈ ci.all` must be keyed on
--      `known (remove_unsafe_rec m)`. Recorded here as a W2 item; no code moves in W0.

-- ============================================================================
-- SLICE Γ-W1 — the motives quantify `Γ`
--
-- THE CHANGE, MEASURED. Inside `visitExpr_refines_erases_core`, every motive with content
-- gained two binders immediately after its run hypothesis,
--
--     ∀ (Γ : ErasureCtx) (_hΓ : Γ = Γ₀.withFixvars Γ.fixvars) Δ, …
--
-- and its `RunConclδ` conjunct was re-indexed to the ambient `Γ₀`. Counted on the diff:
-- 34 motive-signature edits (17 in the theorem's own statement, 17 in the `(motive_i := …)`
-- block — motive 10's conclusion is `True` and nothing calls it, so it stays fixed and the
-- design's "36" is 34 here), 42 `RunConclδ` re-indexes, 17 `intro` lines, 33 IH argument
-- insertions, 12 bundle transports across 9 steps, and one manual site — step 6's callee
-- invariant `hinv'`, retargeted from the motive-local `Γ` to `Γ₀`.
--
-- WHAT DID **NOT** MOVE, and this is the whole design:
--   * the 18 `eraseM_admissible_ok` obligations — the binders live inside the `Q` those
--     helpers quantify, so admissibility never sees them;
--   * the ~135 `Erases env Us Γ` / `BridgeInv … Γ` / `Supported known Γ` / `Γ.…` mentions
--     inside the step bodies — `Γ` is still a variable literally named `Γ`;
--   * `known`, `Esrc`, and all four premise bundles, which stay outer at `Γ₀`;
--   * every consumer. `visitExpr_refines_erases` is the `Γ := Γ₀`,
--     `hΓ := (withFixvars_self Γ).symm` corollary and its four call sites are untouched;
--     `visitExpr_refines_erases_block` and all eight NonVacuity guards are untouched.
--
-- ELABORATION. The mitigation for the design's top risk was to keep `Γ` a bound *variable*
-- rather than substituting `Γ₀.withFixvars fv`, so the goal terms do not grow. Measured:
-- `lake env lean LeanToLambdaBox/VisitExprRefines.lean` runs at 6.05s / 7.81s user after
-- the change against 6.07s / 7.83s user before — no delta, at the unchanged
-- `maxHeartbeats 1000000`.
--
-- AXIOM MOVEMENT: **none**, anywhere. This file's entire output is byte-identical to the
-- Γ-W0 run, which was itself byte-identical to the pre-slice baseline.

-- ============================================================================
-- SLICE Γ-W2 — the block bundle, and the fetch that names the declaration
--
-- (a) THE `decl_run` RELAXATION — the eighth item on the price list, and the one Γ-W0's
-- measurement forced. The conjunct `ci.all = [n]` becomes
--
--     ∃ ci m, r = some ci ∧ ci.all = [m] ∧ remove_unsafe_rec m = n ∧ ci.levelParams = Us
--
-- because `Compiler.LCNF.getDeclInfo?` tries `n._unsafe_rec` first and, at this toolchain,
-- succeeds for every arithmetic declaration the §H benchmarks drag in. At `ci.all = [n]`
-- the field was FALSE at exactly those names — the fragment could not contain them — so
-- this is a repair, not a weakening. Nothing else moves: the run's own test is
-- `ci.all.length == 1`, so the single-declaration prefix is entered either way and step
-- 6's `isFalse` refutation is the same `simp [hall]`; only the `obtain` gains two
-- components. [As of slice Γ-W5 the last sentence is history: `hall` is gone, the
-- `single_decl` `isFalse` is a walk rather than a refutation, and the entry at Γ-W5 below
-- is the current reading.]
--
-- A δ-D8e PREDICTION, FALSIFIED. `rec_exit_registers_stripped_name` was read as buying a
-- further FRAGMENT restriction, `remove_unsafe_rec n = n` for every `known n`, to be paid
-- as a field of the block bundle. The arrow was backwards: the caller's `n` is the plain
-- name, and what carries the suffix is the fetched `ci.all`, which the old conjunct
-- wrongly pinned to `n`. Under the relaxation the registration is under
-- `ci.all.map remove_unsafe_rec = [n]` and NO fragment restriction is bought. The negative
-- theorem stays (retitled); `rec_exit_registers_name` is the positive half, decided on the
-- same `f._unsafe_rec` data.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.rec_exit_registers_stripped_name
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.rec_exit_registers_name

-- (b) THE BLOCK BUNDLE. `BlockHyps` — the companion of `DeltaHyps`, keyed on the recursive
-- exit's own two runs (`getConstInfo`, `prepare_erasure`) rather than on the declaration
-- fetch, which is why none of `DeltaHyps`' run-keyed clauses can fire inside the block.
--
-- THE KEYING IS THE FINDING. Every run-keyed field reads `known (remove_unsafe_rec m)`,
-- not `known m`: the loop's `m` ranges over `ci.all`, which Γ-W0 measured to be the
-- `._unsafe_rec` names, while the fragment holds the plain ones. Keyed the design's way
-- the bundle would be VACUOUSLY satisfiable at exactly the data the slice exists for.
-- `gBlockKeying` decides both halves on the fixture's real shape.
--
-- SEVEN FIELDS BECAME FIVE, AND FOUR OF THE DROPPED ONES ARE THEOREMS. The design listed
-- `stripped`, `block_lparams`, `block_esrc`, `block_prepared`, `block_shape`, `strengthen`,
-- `nonest`. What ships is `block_lparams`, `block_esrc`, `block_lam`, `strengthen`,
-- `nonest`, because:
--   * `stripped` — dissolved by (a) above;
--   * `block_prepared` — `DeltaHyps.prepared` is keyed on ANY `prepare_erasure` run
--     producing `pe` plus `Esrc n = some pe`, and the block loop holds both (the second
--     from `block_esrc`). It fires unchanged;
--   * `block_shape`'s `NoProj` and empty-context translation — `DeltaHyps.esrc_shape`,
--     verbatim, keyed on `Esrc n = some pe` alone;
--   * `block_shape`'s closedness and fvar-freeness — read off that witness
--     (`TrExprS.closed`, `TrExprS.fvarsIn`), which is what `esrc_shape`'s own docstring has
--     said since δ-D7b.
-- Only λ-headedness survives as an assumption, and it survives because no `TrExprS`
-- witness implies it. `BlockHyps.sibling_scope` is the composition, stated as one theorem
-- so that the division of labour between the two bundles is machine-checked: if a conjunct
-- there ever stops being derivable, that is the line that breaks.
--
-- ALSO DROPPED: the `gw` parameter the design gave the structure. No field mentions a
-- generator — `ci_run` and `prep_run` already live in `DeltaHyps` and the block's
-- `mkFreshFVarId` is `BridgeHyps.fresh_run`'s business — so the bundle is
-- generator-free.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.BlockHyps.of_bot
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.BlockHyps.sibling_scope

-- (c) NON-VACUITY, IN THE SAME COMMIT AS THE STRUCTURE — the S1e mitigation the design
-- names explicitly ("land the non-empty instance in the same commit", which is what S1d did
-- not do and paid +776/-269 for). `gBlockHyps` builds the bundle at the recursion fixture
-- `ΓfixRec` with the fragment `{f}` and `Esrc` recording `fixRecSrc`; the one genuine scope
-- field, `block_lam`, is DISCHARGED there rather than assumed, and `gBlockLam_nonvacuous`
-- checks it has something to say. The two run clauses and the two residues stay
-- hypothetical, for the reasons their own docstrings give.

#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.gBlockHyps
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.gBlockLam_nonvacuous

-- (d) THE LAYERING FIX — the obstruction slice Γ-W0 discovered and could only record.
-- Step 6 must call `erases_rec_block_of_run`, `blockMap_getElem?_inv` and
-- `closeFix_eq_block_fold`, and all three lived in `ColdStartDelta.lean`, which is
-- STRICTLY DOWNSTREAM of `VisitExprRefines.lean`:
--
--     VisitExprRefines → EnvErasureNonrec → EnvErasureRec → ColdStartDelta
--
-- Three options were priced against the real import graph before anything moved.
--
--   (a) MOVE the lemmas below the bridge. 614 lines relocated, 0 added, 2 one-line
--       imports, 0 consumer edits, no cycle. TAKEN.
--   (b) SPLIT `VisitExprRefines` (3262 lines; the induction core is 1306-2715, and 37 of
--       the 61 prelude declarations are used directly by it, so the cut is 1305/1957).
--       INFEASIBLE ON ITS OWN: for the core to sit below the four lemmas, `EnvErasureNonrec`
--       and `ColdStartShape` would have to sit below `ColdStartDelta`, which is what
--       `ColdStartDelta` is built on — a cycle. (b) is therefore (a) PLUS a 1957-line split,
--       strictly dominated.
--   (c) HYPOTHESIS FORM, on the `run_visitMutual_ok` vE-generalisation precedent
--       (`ErasureRun.lean`: "in Hoare form the same lemma serves both the inline and the
--       standalone use"). All four facts ARE phrasable in `VisitExprRefines`' scope — only
--       `KeysDistinct` is out of scope, and it inlines to `List.Pairwise` + `Kername.beq`.
--       But ~85 lines of premise would propagate from the core through
--       `visitExpr_refines_erases{,_block}` to `ShippingCorrect`, `ShippingCorrectData`,
--       `FirstOrderShippingIota` and `EnvErasureNonrec` — four capstone-class theorems
--       turning conditional — and the four in-file non-vacuity guards could not discharge
--       them at all, weakening the joint-satisfiability story. Kept as the fallback that
--       cannot fail; not needed.
--
-- WHY (a) IS CHEAP, which is the finding. The entire proof cone of `erases_fix_of_open_nil`
-- — `substFix_mkLambdas`, `Erases.instFixvars`, `hasFVar_mkLambdas`, `erases_target_fvars`,
-- `erases_fix_of_closed` — references NOTHING from `EnvErasureNonrec` or from any `Cold*`
-- module. It lives on `FixUnfold`, `ErasesStrengthen`, `Closed`, `Abstract`, `Erases`,
-- `FixMetatheory`, `ErasureContext` — every one already in `VisitExprRefines`' import
-- closure. `EnvErasureRec` was downstream only because its Part 3 needs
-- `EnvErasureNonrec.RegisteredClosure`. `blockMap_getElem?_inv` is pure Std/List.
-- So `RecBlockErasure.lean` adds ZERO modules to the closure; it re-slices existing ones.
--
-- ONE CORRECTION TO THE BRIEF: `recEnvConsistent_of_block` is NOT a step-6 input and did
-- not move. Step 6's motive-6 conclusion is a `RunConclδ`, whose recursive extension step
-- is `DeltaHyps.RunConclδ.recBlock` — upstream already, and fed by
-- `erases_rec_block_of_run`'s conclusion. `RecEnvConsistent` is capstone-level; leaving it
-- downstream leaves `KeysDistinct` and `ColdStartShape`'s env-lookup kit downstream too,
-- which is where the remaining risk of the move would have lived.
--
-- The move is VERBATIM: every name, statement and proof unchanged, no consumer edited,
-- `EnvErasureRec` and `ColdStartDelta` re-acquiring the names transitively. The entries
-- below are the moved theorems, re-run from their new home.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- SLICE Γ-W3 — step 6 walks the recursive exit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- (a) THE OUTPUT-SHAPE OBSTRUCTION, and the design claim it falsifies.
--
-- The design's premise ledger for `erases_rec_block_of_run` routed `hoclosed` (each opened
-- block body is de-Bruijn closed) to `ColdStartInduction.visitExpr_noFix_closed`, annotated
-- "no hypotheses". Inside `visitExpr_refines_erases_core` that is unavailable TWICE OVER:
-- `ColdStartInduction` sits downstream of the bridge, and — the substantive half — the
-- eraser at step 6 is the induction's ABSTRACT fixpoint argument `vE`, about which only the
-- motives may be assumed. No motive carries an output shape, and adding one is not a local
-- change: the IH call graph is one SCC (Γ-W1), so `LBClosed` in motive 1 means `LBClosed` in
-- all seventeen content motives, i.e. a second copy of `ColdStartInduction.visitExpr_shape`.
--
-- The fact is instead read off the ONE thing the motive does hand back — the `Erases`
-- derivation. Erasure moves de-Bruijn indices but never invents one: `Erases.bvar` copies
-- the source's index, every binder rule extends `Δ` exactly where its target extends scope,
-- and the two fix leaves carry `hshift`, which `lbClosed_of_shift_eq` reads back as
-- closedness. That converse is the closedness twin of
-- `FixUnfold.not_hasFVar_of_toBvar_eq_self`, which reads `htobv` the same way — and the
-- parallel is exact, down to which premise of `Erases.const_fix`/`Erases.fix` is consumed.
--
-- All three are pure target-side / relation-side reasoning, hence sorryAx-free.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.lbClosed_of_shift_eq
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.LBClosed.mkLambdas_inv
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.erases_target_lbClosed

-- …and the `mkDef` output fact `Erases.fix`'s `hrarg` needs. `run_mkDef_ok` had four
-- conjuncts and three destructuring call sites; the fifth fact is stated apart so those are
-- untouched.
#print axioms Erasure.run_mkDef_rarg

-- (b) THE WALK ITSELF. `rec_exit_refines_erases` takes the recursive exit's run at an
-- ABSTRACT eraser together with that eraser's motive-1 refinement hypothesis — which is
-- exactly the shape step 6 of `visitExpr_refines_erases_core` holds — and derives all
-- three conjuncts of `visitMutual`'s motive. Everything the design listed as W3 content is
-- discharged: the id loop (`run_mkFreshFVarId_list`, whose `Nodup` output feeds both block
-- lookups), the chained sibling loop (`run_rec_exit_siblings_chained`), the per-sibling
-- `BridgeInv` rebuild at the block-local `Γ₀.withFixvars fv` (`BridgeInv.withFixvars` +
-- `ErasureCtx.coh_withFixvars` + `BlockHyps.block_lparams`), the erasure IH invoked THERE
-- (Γ-W1's instantiation, guard (i''')), `Supported.withFixvars`, the `Δ → []`
-- strengthening (`Erases.strengthen_fvlift` against `BlockHyps.strengthen`),
-- `erases_rec_block_of_run`, `RunConclδ.recBlock`, and the registration conclusion
-- (`Erasure.recConstState_get?`).
--
-- Its axiom set is a SUBSET of the core theorem's: no `sorryAx`, and the three
-- `Persistent*` modeling axioms it inherits are the ones every run-lemma consumer carries.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.ErasureCtx.coh_withFixvars
#print axioms Erasure.recConstState_get?
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.rec_exit_refines_erases

-- (c) AND THE ONE PREMISE THAT DID NOT FALL, with its refutation.
--
-- `hreg` — "`Γ₀` records *this* block for each of its own names" — is `Erases.fix`'s own
-- registration premise. `Γ₀` is fixed before the run builds `defs`, which
-- `ColdStartDelta`'s ledger already called irreducible AT A PARAMETER `Γ`; Γ-W3 confirms
-- it one level further in. Inside the induction the eraser is the abstract fixpoint
-- argument, so any premise pinning the block must quantify over it — and every such
-- phrasing is CONTRADICTORY, not merely strong: two erasers hand back two different
-- blocks and `Γ₀.recBodies` records one. A `BlockHyps` field of that shape would be
-- vacuously satisfiable exactly where the slice needs it, which is the S1d/S1e failure
-- mode the repo priced at +776/−269. So it stays an explicit hypothesis of the walk,
-- discharged by a caller who holds a concrete run.
--
-- TWO DESIGN ROWS FALSIFIED on the way, both about where a fact comes from:
--   * `hoclosed` was routed to `ColdStartInduction.visitExpr_noFix_closed`, "no
--     hypotheses". Unavailable twice over inside the induction — wrong layer, and no
--     motive carries an output shape. Replaced by `erases_target_lbClosed` (Γ-W3a);
--   * `hrarg` was assumed to come from `Erasure.run_mkDef_ok`, which does not state it.
--     `Erasure.run_mkDef_rarg` does (Γ-W3a).
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.rec_exit_agreement_eraser_quantified_refuted
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.rec_exit_block_ne_of_body_ne

-- (d) THE MOVE. `lbClosed_toBvar` and the binder-closing folds lived in `OutputShape.lean`,
-- which sits below `ErasesCorrectData` and is imported only by `ColdStartInduction` — i.e.
-- strictly downstream of the bridge, the same layering objection Γ-W2c met. Relocated
-- verbatim into `Closed.lean` (which gains one import, `Abstract`, already in the bridge's
-- closure), so `OutputShape` re-acquires them transitively and no consumer moves.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.lbClosed_toBvar
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.lbClosed_foldl_zipIdx
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.lbClosed_fix_of_bodies

-- (e) AND THE ROUTE THAT WOULD DISSOLVE `hreg`, recorded because it is now the only one.
-- Keyed on the block loop at the SHIPPING `Erasure.visitExpr`, `hreg` is satisfiable — it
-- is the premise `EnvErasureRec.RegisteredClosureRec` has always carried. What blocks step
-- 6 is only that its eraser is abstract. Teaching the motives that the abstract eraser's
-- successful runs are the fixpoint's — a conjunct admissible in exactly the
-- `eraseM_admissible_ok₁` sense, whose eighteen step obligations are the componentwise
-- monotonicity of the erasure functional, available as
-- `Erasure.visitExpr.mutual._proof_1 : Lean.Order.monotone …` — is a second Γ-W1-shaped
-- pass plus order-theoretic plumbing. Priced in `ColdStart`'s residue-1 row; not attempted
-- here.

-- ============================================================================
-- Projection round, slice P3: the first constructed `TrProj` (`ProjPattern.lean`).
--
-- Nobody — upstream or downstream — had ever CONSTRUCTED a `TrProj env U Γ S i e e'`.
-- Every downstream statement about projections was therefore possibly vacuous, and the
-- nine-slice projection round is staked on the answer. It is now settled in the
-- affirmative, at two shapes and both polarities.
--
-- These are CONSTRUCTED guards on a synthetic `VEnv` built with `VEnv.addPat`, so — as
-- for `envι_iota_fires` — they must be **sorryAx-free**, and they are: `[propext,
-- Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, the ambient set of the `simp` calls in the
-- `constants`-lookup lemmas. No `VEnv.WF` is claimed; `VEnv.Ordered` has no `addPat`
-- clause and `addInduct_WF` is `sorry` upstream, which is why these are `addPat`-built
-- and not `addInduct`-built.
--
-- WHAT THE CONSTRUCTION COST, i.e. the recipe for slices P4-P7: five of `TrProj`'s six
-- conjuncts are `rfl`, `VEnv.addPat_self` and `by simp`. The whole cost is
-- `∃ A, env.HasType U Γ e' A`, and inside it the whole cost is ONE conversion — the
-- recursor's minor premise wants `∀ f̄, motive (mk params f̄)` while the field selector
-- naturally has `∀ f̄, fieldTys[i]`, and a CONSTANT motive makes the two definitionally
-- equal by a single β step under `forallEDF` congruences (`hconvP`/`hconvQ`).
--
-- AND THE LINE IT DRAWS (survey item R2, answered): the constant motive works iff
-- `fieldTys[i]` does not mention the field binders `f₀ … f_{i-1}`. So field 0 of ANY
-- structure — dependent or not — is as easy as this file, and so is every typeclass
-- method; a field i > 0 whose type genuinely depends on an earlier field (`Sigma.snd`)
-- needs the motive `fun p => β p.0`, i.e. β PLUS a firing of the ι rule. That case is
-- inhabitable by the same kit and is NOT attempted here — the round's one residue on
-- this axis, and a narrow one.
-- ============================================================================
-- Positive, at `MyProd` (np = 1, one ctor, TWO fields, no indices): both fields, at a
-- variable discriminant and at a saturated constructor spine. Two fields so that

-- SLICE Γ-W3.5 — THE APPROXIMATION CONJUNCT, AND THE WALL BEHIND THE WALL
-- ============================================================================
--
-- Γ-W3c priced a route out of the one premise `rec_exit_refines_erases` leaves standing.
-- This slice paid it. Three things to check here: that the toolkit is clean, that the
-- crown theorems did not move, and that the walk's own axiom set did not grow.
--
-- (a) THE TOOLKIT. `⊑` is `partial_fixpoint`'s own order on `EraseM`. `run_ok_of_le` is
--     the only direction the bridge consumes — below the fixpoint a *successful* run is
--     the fixpoint's run, verbatim — and it is also the correction to Γ-W3c's wording:
--     the conjunct CANNOT be the run-ok implication that slice named. Run-ok agreement is
--     strictly weaker than `⊑` (`EST.bot` is an `.error`, so an eraser that errors where
--     the fixpoint succeeds satisfies it) and the erasure functional does not preserve
--     it; monotonicity gives `F x ⊑ F y` from `x ⊑ y` and there is no run-ok analogue to
--     feed. So the motives carry `⊑`, and run-ok is its corollary.
--
--     `admissible_and_le` is why the eighteen admissibility obligations cost nothing: a
--     chain below the fixpoint has its supremum below it (`CCPO.csup_le`), and Γ-W3c's
--     other reading — that the new conjunct's `Q` does not mention `f` — holds.
--     `fix_step_le` is `Lean.Order.fix_eq` read as an inequality, and `mutual_le_of`
--     packs the step's eighteen hypotheses into the `PProd` chain
--     `Erasure.visitExpr.mutual` inhabits, so that
--     `Erasure.visitExpr.mutual._proof_1 : Lean.Order.monotone …` — the monotonicity proof
--     `partial_fixpoint` generated for the erasure family itself — discharges each step
--     obligation with one projection. Nothing here is a conjecture and nothing is new
--     mathematics; the eighteen `_eq_mutual` slot equations exist only because
--     `partial_fixpoint` seals each member behind an `@[irreducible] def`.

-- (b) THE TRANSPORT. `⊑` travels under the recursive exit's sibling `mapM` by
--     `List.monotone_mapM` and `Erasure.withReader_mono` alone — no fact about the
--     erasure family is needed, only that the eraser occurs positively in the loop body.
--     That is what lets a walk at an ABSTRACT eraser feed a premise stated at the
--     SHIPPING one.

-- (c) THE CROWN FOUR DID NOT MOVE. Both bridge theorems keep the same seven axioms they
--     had at Γ-W3c — `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound` and lean4lean's four
--     modeling axioms — and `visitExpr_refines_erases`' STATEMENT is byte-identical: the
--     new conjunct is a tautology at the fixpoint, so the export projects one `.1`
--     further and nothing else changed. `rec_exit_refines_erases` keeps its six, a subset.

--
-- (d) WHAT THE SLICE BOUGHT, AND WHAT IT DID NOT — the honest half.
--
--     BOUGHT. `hreg` used to be stated at the induction's abstract eraser, where every
--     phrasing is *contradictory*: two erasers hand back two blocks and `Γ₀.recBodies`
--     records one (`rec_exit_agreement_eraser_quantified_refuted`, with
--     `rec_exit_block_ne_of_body_ne` as its instance on real leaves). It is now
--     `RecBlockRegistered`, keyed on `Erasure.visitExpr`, where there is one block per
--     `(names, ids, ctx, s₀, wi)`. Guard (iv'') is the fixture Γ-W3 could not state: the
--     walk fires at exactly the data step 6 holds — an abstract eraser, its motive-1
--     PAIR, and the shipping-keyed premise. Guard (iv') is the same composition at the
--     induction's conclusion, where the approximation half is trivial.
--
--     NOT BOUGHT. Step 6 still refutes the recursive exit, and `DeltaHyps.nonrecursive`
--     (scope restriction 5) stands. The obstruction is a DIFFERENT quantifier and this is
--     the first slice that can name it: `hreg` is stated at *a* reader and *a* state, and
--     step 6's motive quantifies both, so a bundle-level premise would have to quantify
--     them too. Unlike the eraser quantification that premise is not provably
--     contradictory — there is only one eraser now, so the two-blocks argument has
--     nothing to run on — but it is not SUPPLIABLE either: readers differing in
--     `Erasure.Config` erase the same block to different `defs`, the only reader/`Γ₀`
--     coherence available at this level is `BridgeInv.natcfg` and that is
--     one-directional, and a caller who built `Γ₀` by running the eraser holds one reader
--     and one state rather than all of them. A `DeltaHyps` field of that shape was
--     written, compiled and REVERTED in this slice for exactly that reason: it would have
--     been the S1d/S1e failure mode with `ctx` in the role `known` played there — a
--     premise vacuously satisfiable precisely where the slice needs it. The measurement
--     is recorded rather than the field.

-- ============================================================================
-- SLICE Γ-W3.6a — THE CONFIG GATE
-- ============================================================================
--
-- The measurement Γ-W3.5 recorded above named a *reader/state* quantifier as what keeps
-- step 6's recursive branch closed. This slice takes the reader half of it apart, and the
-- finding is that only one field of the reader was ever at issue.
--
-- (a) CONFIG IS A RUN INVARIANT, AND NOW THE INVARIANT SAYS SO. `ErasureContext` has four
--     fields. Of the five `withReader` sites in the shipping eraser — `withLocalDecl`,
--     `withLocalDef`, `visitMutual`'s non-recursive exit, its block entry, its per-sibling
--     loop — not one touches `config`; `{ … with config := … }` occurs nowhere in the
--     eraser; `ReaderT.adapt`/`withTheReader` are never used; and the only reader built
--     from scratch is `Erasure.run`'s `{ config }`. So `BridgeInv.cfg : ctx.config = cfg₀`
--     costs five transport lines and ten construction sites, eight of them `rfl`, and
--     ZERO changes at the transport application sites — the field travels wherever the
--     invariant does. `BridgeInv.withFixvars` already demanded `hcfg : ctx'.config =
--     ctx.config` for `natcfg`, supplied by `rfl` at both of its call sites, so the fully
--     general reader is pinned there too.

--
-- (b) THE FIX-ONCE BONUS. Two SHIPPED fields carry the same defect the Γ-W3.5 objection
--     names, and they carried it since Γ-W2: `DeltaHyps.prep_esrc` and
--     `BlockHyps.block_esrc` quantify the reader of a `prepare_erasure` run and pin its
--     OUTPUT to a value fixed before the run — while that output demonstrably depends on
--     `ctx.config.csimp`. Ungated, the clause identifies the bodies two configs prepare,
--     which for an `Esrc` that distinguishes them is contradictory. Both are now gated on
--     `ctx.config = cfg₀`, the bundles carrying `cfg₀` as a parameter. This STRENGTHENS
--     the fields (they say less), so every consumer keeps working: each holds a
--     `BridgeInv` and reads the equation off `BridgeInv.cfg`, with
--     `RecBlockErasure.blockReader_config` (`rfl`) covering the block loop's reader.

#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.gBlockHyps
--
-- (c) WHAT THE `∀ ids` QUANTIFIER COSTS: NOTHING, AND HERE IS THE MEASUREMENT.
--     `RecBlockRegistered` quantifies the block's fresh ids. They do not survive into the
--     block it speaks about: `erases_target_fvars` says an fvar-free source erases to a
--     target whose free variables are fixvars of the context (`Erases.fvar` is the only
--     rule that can invent one and its source-side premise is `False`), and
--     `not_hasFVar_closeFix` says `mkDef`'s fold abstracts exactly those. So the stored
--     body is `FVarId`-free.
--
--     What this does NOT buy — and the reason the premise stays an assumption rather than
--     becoming a theorem — is equivariance: "no id occurs in the output" is not "two runs
--     from different generator states build the same output", which would need a renaming
--     induction over the whole eighteen-motive family. And the premise's world quantifier
--     ranges over Core environments, so no such theorem exists to be had at all.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.rec_exit_block_fvar_free
--
-- (d) THE CROWN DID NOT MOVE. Both bridge theorems keep the seven axioms they had at
--     Γ-W3.5 — `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound` and lean4lean's four modeling
--     axioms — and `rec_exit_refines_erases` keeps its six. A parameter and a `rfl`-valued
--     field add nothing.

-- ============================================================================
-- SLICE Γ-W3.6b — THE TRADE, AND THE WALK
-- ============================================================================
--
-- The recursion wall's last brick. `DeltaHyps.nonrecursive` is DELETED and the bridge's
-- step 6 WALKS `visitMutual`'s recursive exit; the `absurd` is gone.
--
-- (a) THE PREMISE. `RecBlockAgreement` is `Erases.fix`'s own registration premise, stated
--     over the configurations the induction quantifies. It is not a theorem — `Γ₀` is
--     fixed before the run builds `defs` — but its quantifiers are GATED, and that is the
--     whole content of the slice: on the fragment (`known (remove_unsafe_rec m)` plus
--     `Nodup`, keyed as `BlockHyps` is), and on `BridgeInv`, whose `cfg` field pins the
--     config (Γ-W3.6a) and whose `consts`/`knames` pin the registry. The two refutations
--     anyone could write — two configs, one non-canonical registry — are therefore closed
--     rather than assumed away. What is left free is `ctx.lctx`, `s.inductives` and the
--     world, which is exactly what `DeltaHyps.prep_esrc`, `BlockHyps.block_esrc` and
--     `BridgeHyps.fresh_run` have carried since they shipped.

#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.RecBlockAgreement.of_bot
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.gRecAgreement
--
-- (b) THE NEGATIVE RECORD STANDS, AND IS NOW LABELLED. The eraser-quantified phrasing is
--     still refuted, with its exhibited instance on real leaves; that is why the premise is
--     keyed on `Erasure.visitExpr`. The READER-quantified refutation — "two configs, two
--     blocks" — is the one that would have applied to `RecBlockAgreement`, and it cannot be
--     instantiated any more: `BridgeInv.cfg` admits one config. Closed by the gate, not
--     withdrawn.

#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.bridgeInv_blockReader_refuted
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.bridgeInv_rec_exit_reader_refuted
--
-- (c) THE TRADE, AS A COUNT. `DeltaHyps` loses one field and one scope restriction (five
--     become four): a recursive fragment constant is no longer excluded. What replaces it
--     is two premises of the bridge — `Hβ : BlockHyps` (which the walk needed anyway) and
--     `Hreg` — both of the `block_esrc` class, and at `known = ⊥` `Hreg` is a theorem, so
--     the block instantiation `visitExpr_refines_erases_block` picks it up for free.

--
-- (d) THE CROWN, AGAIN. Two premises and a deleted field change no axiom set. Both bridge
--     theorems keep their seven, `rec_exit_refines_erases` its six, and the capstones are
--     verbatim what they were — they gained `Hβ`/`Hreg` as premises, which is a widening of
--     the hypothesis list, not of the trust base.

-- ============================================================================
-- Projection round, slices P0 / P1 / P4 (2026-08-27).
--
-- P3 settled that `TrProj` is inhabited. These three slices build the model on top of
-- it: a `Γ` column, an `Erases` rule, and the upstream interface. THE ROUND ADDS NO
-- AXIOM AND NO `sorryAx`. Every declaration below measures either `[propext]` or the
-- three standard axioms, and the crown four did not move — `visitExpr_refines_erases`
-- and `_core` keep their seven, `rec_exit_refines_erases` its six.
--
-- (a) P0 — THE COLUMN, AND THE DE-OPACIFICATION.
--
--     `ErasureCtx.projs` is the one datum `visitProj` reads that no other field
--     supplies: `Expr.proj S i e` names only the STRUCTURE TYPE, while `ctorArities` is
--     keyed on the constructor and `casesOns` is populated only when the walk saw a
--     `casesOn` — which a projection-only structure never produces.
--
--     `NoFix` and `NoBlock` stopped being `True` at `.proj`. The stated reason for the
--     opaque clause covered `.construct` only; `.proj` was unreachable because `Erases`
--     had no rule. It has one now, and `NoFix (.proj p t) = True` would hide a `.fix`
--     under a projection from the very exclusion the data simulation runs on. The
--     forced conclusion-position repairs numbered FOUR, not the ~20 the design
--     predicted, because the `.proj` arms of the `LBClosed` inductions were already
--     recursive; one of the four is in `ColdStartInduction.lean`, which is the round's
--     only edit outside its own lane.
--
--     The env records are `ErasesEnvCases`' transposes, and `ProjFieldsCoherent` is
--     `CtorFieldsCoherent`'s twin keyed on `projs` — a twin rather than a widened
--     hypothesis, so the original's six call sites stay byte-identical. All discharged
--     from registration and guarded at `AC`, which is literally the `is_struct` shape —
--     and guarded on the SAME `Γproj` the model-side rule guards use, so `projInd`
--     (the `InductiveId` in the emitted `ProjectionInfo`) and `acIid` (the one `acΓ`
--     registers) are demonstrably one inductive, by `rfl`.

--
-- (b) P1 — THE RULE. `Erases.proj` reads `visitProj` back off `Γ`, carries ONE
--     sub-derivation, and — deliberately — NO `TrExprS` premise. `box`/`lam`/`letE`
--     carry one because they record a `VExpr` witness that must transport; this rule's
--     target carries none. Adding one would cost an equational-uniqueness obligation
--     that is FALSE at `.proj`: `TrProj` pins `params`/`fieldTys` only up to defeq,
--     which is why `TrProj.uniq` claims `IsDefEqU`.
--
--     Eleven structural arms, all one-liners. The twelfth — `Erases.strengthen_fvlift`
--     — is VACUOUS, its scope predicate being `NoProj`, and that is exactly the wall
--     slice P2 exists to move; the arm records the reason rather than hiding it.
--
--     Guards at both polarities on `Γproj` (one parameter, one field, so `2 = 1 + 1`
--     decomposes non-degenerately): positive at a variable and at a saturated
--     constructor spine, negative as `Erases.proj_none` — at `Γ.projs = ⊥` the only
--     erasure of a projection is `box`.

--
-- (c) P4 — THE INTERFACE, AND WHY IT IS NOT `of_trEnv`.
--
--     `TrEnv.proj_defeq` is still `sorry` at `7a5e96d`, and — this is the finding, and
--     it SURVIVED the motive re-pin, which fixed `TrProj.uniq` and nothing here — it is
--     also missing a hypothesis. Its `hp : TrProj …` carries its own existentially
--     bound constructor name; its `hd` supplies a different, universally quantified one
--     for the spine the discriminant is defeq to; nothing ties them. Since
--     `Pattern.Matches` on `SimplePattern.iota recName _ ctorName' _` matches the major
--     premise against `ctorName'`, the reduction cannot fire without the agreement, and
--     recovering it from `TrEnv` + `HasType` is a canonicity argument rather than a
--     rewrite. So the statement is plausibly UNPROVABLE as written. Escalated as a
--     STATEMENT correction, not a proof request.
--
--     `TrProjCtor` is `TrProj` with that name exposed, and the two conversions below
--     show the exposure is a reparenthesisation, not a strengthening. `ProjDefeqSpec`
--     states the reduction over it; `ProjShape` is the `rfl`-checkable certificate whose
--     `ival.ctors = [ctor]` conjunct supplies the agreement locally.
--
--     `ProjDefeqSpec.of_trEnv` is DELIBERATELY ABSENT. It is one line and
--     `TrProjCtor.toTrProj` is the piece it needs, but calling `TrEnv.proj_defeq` today
--     injects the upstream PROJ-TODO `sorryAx`, and this round adds none. The interface
--     stays a NAMED PREMISE — the `PatsIotaSpec` idiom — so the injection point, when it
--     comes, is one declaration.
--
--     [SUPERSEDED at the `6fd8a1d` re-pin, 2026-09-09 — see §MIGRATION at the end of this
--     file. `TrProjCtor.toTrProj` and `TrProj.exists_ctorName` were DELETED upstream when
--     `TrProj` became the existential closure of `TrProjCtor`, so the two probes that
--     stood here are gone rather than moved: there is nothing to measure, the anonymous
--     constructor and `obtain` do the work. And `of_trEnv` is no longer deliberately
--     absent — `TrEnv.proj_defeq` is PROVED, so it is landed and real. The paragraph
--     above is kept as the record of what was true at `b6a5a38`.]

--
-- (d) WHAT DID NOT LAND, AND WHY — two rules the slicing said were free and are not.
--
--     `Supported.proj` (planned P1) is NOT independent of P8. Step 1 of
--     `visitExpr_refines_erases_core` analyses `hsupp` by a complete `cases`, so a new
--     alternative of `Supported` is a new arm there, and only MOTIVE 10 can discharge
--     it — and motive 10 concludes `True`. Giving it content needs a `ProjBridgeHyps`
--     bundle and a new premise on the bridge theorem.
--
--     `SEvalDataι.proj` (planned P1) is NOT independent of P6+P7, for the same
--     structural reason at a different relation: THREE complete inductions run over
--     `SEvalDataι` (`SEvalDataι_defeq`, `erases_correct_dataι`,
--     `SEvalDataι_partial_cases_lam_elim`), so a new constructor is three new arms, two
--     of which need `ProjConsistent` threaded through twelve call sites and the full
--     simulation case.
--
--     Both are structural facts about complete case analyses, not proof difficulty, and
--     both mean the round has fewer independent slices than nine. What IS independent
--     and did land is the whole model layer: the column, the rule, the predicates, the
--     env records and the upstream interface.
--
--     `ProjConsistent` is defined (`SourceEvalData.lean`) as the premise those slices
--     will take. It is a `Prop` HYPOTHESIS, never an axiom, and — like `IotaConsistent`
--     — it stays one even once derivable, because that is what keeps `safety`/`kenv`
--     out of the `VEnv`-level statements.

-- ============================================================================
-- SLICE Γ-W4 — `hnorec` DIES; THE RECURSIVE COLD-START CAPSTONE
-- ============================================================================
--
-- The finale of the recursion wall on the capstone side. Γ-W3.6b landed the PRODUCER —
-- step 6 walks `visitMutual`'s recursive exit — and left the CONSUMER half: both
-- cold-start capstones still carried `hnorec : Γ.recBodies = ⊥`, an S-class scope
-- restriction that excluded every recursive program from the statement. It is DELETED.
--
-- (a) WHAT REPLACED IT. One premise, `RecCovered Γ Esrc sf`, stated about the run's final
--     state: every constant `Γ` records as recursive is in the fragment's source
--     environment and has ITS block stored under its kername. It is the CONVERSE of
--     `RecBlockAgreement` — that one reads run → `Γ` (the block a run builds is the block
--     `Γ` records, which is `Erases.fix`'s `hreg`), this one reads `Γ` → run — and neither
--     derives the other: a `Γ` may name a block for a constant the program never calls,
--     and then no walk registers anything for it. So it is premised, of the
--     registration-agreement class, and at `Γ.recBodies = ⊥` it is a THEOREM
--     (`RecCovered.of_noRec`), which is how every `known = ⊥` guard picks it up for free —
--     the mirror of `RecBlockAgreement.of_bot`.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.RecCovered
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.RecCovered.of_noRec
--
-- (b) THE CONVERSION, AND WHAT IT COST. `recEnvConsistent_of_deltaMem_walked` is
--     `registeredClosureData_of_deltaMem_walked` with the applied-form conjunct dropped
--     and the coverage agreement added: `hdisj`/`hclenv`/`huni` are the SAME THREE
--     ARGUMENTS a capstone already assembles for its `ErasesEnvDeltaData`, so the
--     recursive record costs exactly one new premise and no new machinery. The `Erases`
--     conjunct is DERIVED — `DeltaMem` is keyed on the recorded entry and says nothing
--     about its shape, so a `.fix` body was inside its statement all along, and the walked
--     exit's `DeltaMem.recBlock` is what puts one there.
--
--     No single-block restriction, unlike `recEnvConsistent_of_block`: the conversion is
--     keyed per name on `Γ.recBodies n`, so a `Γ` describing several blocks costs nothing.
--     What stays single-declaration is the SUBJECT — `Erasure.erase` erases one term.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.recEnvConsistent_of_deltaMem_walked
--
-- (c) SUPPLIABILITY, ON REAL RECURSIVE DATA — the S1d/S1e test, run twice. The premise
--     that replaces a deleted scope restriction must not be one nothing can satisfy.
--     `gRecCoveredD8` computes it on the self-referential fixture `def f (a : Prop) := f a`
--     at the state the walked recursive exit produces; `gDeltaMemRecD8` builds the δ record
--     there through `DeltaMem.recBlock` (the extension step that exit fires) with the
--     `Erases.fix` witness DERIVED by `erases_rec_block_of_run`; and
--     `gRecEnvConsistentWalkedD8` runs the whole conversion end to end at a `Γ` that
--     genuinely registers recursion — `hnest` the only thing left hypothetical.

--
-- (d) THE DELIVERABLE: A COLD-START ENTRY-POINT THEOREM ON A RECURSIVE PROGRAM.
--     `ΓFOrec` grafts the fixture's block onto `ΓFOd`'s nullary constructor, and
--     `ΓFOrec_norec_refuted` is the measurement that makes the guard mean something: the
--     deleted premise is FALSE there, so before this slice no cold-start capstone could
--     speak about that `Γ` at all. The graft is forced, not cosmetic — `FirstOrderValue`
--     has exactly one constructor (`.ctor`), so at a `Γ` registering no constructor the

-- (e) THE VACUITY THE GUARD NEARLY WAS. Its first version ran at `envFO` and proved
--     NOTHING: `DeltaHyps.esrc_shape` demands a `TrExprS` translation of every body the
--     fragment records, `fixRecSrc` mentions `.const f []`, and `envFO` does not declare
--     `f` — so the `Hδ` bundle is UNINHABITABLE there and taking it hypothetically is
--     taking `False`. The fix is the environment: `envRec` declares `f` as an AXIOM of
--     type `Prop → I`, which is the honest modelling (a recursive definition has no kernel
--     defining equation — that is why the eraser fetches `f._unsafe_rec`).
--     `gRecEsrcShape` discharges the field that was unsatisfiable and `gRecScope` the
--     other three fragment-scope fields, so nothing in the bundle is hypothetical because
--     it is empty. This is the S1d/S1e discipline applied from the environment side, and
--     it is the one design claim of this slice that failed on first contact.

-- (e') AND ONE PREMISE CAME OUT BETTER THAN PRICED. `hcon : SEnvConsistent` is
--     DISCHARGED at the recursive fixture, by η: the source body `fun (a : Prop) => f a`
--     is `f`'s η-expansion and `VEnv.IsDefEq.eta` is a rule of lean4lean's theory. That is
--     a property of this fixture, not of recursion. The structural fact behind it is worth
--     keeping: a well-formed `VEnv` cannot carry a SELF-REFERENTIAL defining equation,
--     because `VDecl.def` types a constant's value in the environment BEFORE the constant
--     is added. So for a general recursive constant `hcon` is never the `envδ`-style

-- ============================================================================
-- SLICE proj-P2 — `NoProjBinders`: THE TYPECLASS LAYER STOPS BEING EXCLUDED
-- ============================================================================
--
-- The wall this slice takes down is NOT `Erases` and NOT `TrProj`: since P1 the erasure
-- relation has a `proj` rule and since `fee3ada` `TrProj` is a real, inhabited definition
-- (P3). What still excluded every class method was a SCOPE PREDICATE:
-- `DeltaHyps.esrc_shape` demanded `NoProj pe` of every body the fragment records, and
-- `NoProj (.proj ..) = False`, while `OfNat.ofNat`'s prepared body IS a projection —
-- `fun α x self => self.1`. So the field was uninhabitable for the whole
-- typeclass-dispatch layer no matter what could be derived about it.
--
-- (a) WHERE THE PREDICATE IS ACTUALLY SPENT — the measurement that sizes the slice.
--     `Erases.strengthen_fvlift` THREADS `NoProj` through all sixteen arms but CONSUMES it
--     at exactly three: a boxed subterm (whole), a λ binder's type, and a `let`'s type and
--     value — the three positions where `Erases` records a `VExpr` witness an `FVLift` must
--     match ON THE NOSE. `NoProjBinders` keeps the binder-shaped ones and drops the rest.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.NoProjBinders
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.NoProj.toNoProjBinders
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.NoProjBinders.toConstructor
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.noProjBinders_foldl_app
--
-- (b) THE BOX ARM, RE-PROVED THROUGH DEFEQ. The boxed-subterm position cannot simply be
--     dropped — a boxed proof may itself contain a projection (`And` is a structure) — so
--     it is PAID FOR: `TrExprS.uniq` gives a definitional equality where `TrExprS.unique`
--     gave an equation, and `Erasable.defeq` transports the irrelevance witness along it.
--     That is the module docstring's own "survivable in `box`, fatal in `lam`" split, cashed.
--
--     THE PREMISE COST, AND A DESIGN CLAIM CORRECTED. The design priced this as
--     "`hΔ' : Δ'.FVWF` strengthens to `VLCtx.WF`" and called it free. It is not obviously
--     available: `erases_weakFV`'s docstring records that `VLCtx.WF` CANNOT survive this
--     induction, because the `lam`/`letE` arms descend to `(none, .vlam ty') :: Δ'` and
--     `Erases.lam` carries no `IsType`. It survives HERE for a reason that lemma has no
--     analogue of — `hwt`, the small-context translation, is a premise, and lean4lean's
--     `TrExprS.lam`/`TrExprS.letE` DO record the binder's `IsType`/`HasType`, so the
--     extended context's `VLocalDecl.WF` is that witness weakened along `W.toCtx`.
--     `env.Ordered` also strengthens to `env.WF`. Both are held by every caller already.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.Erases.strengthen_fvlift_binders
--
-- (c) TWO LEMMAS, NOT ONE — and this is the whole trust story of the slice.
--     `TrExprS.uniq` bottoms out in `TrProj.uniq`, still `PROJ-TODO`, so the defeq route
--     carries `sorryAx` where the equational route does not. Rather than move that reach
--     into declarations that were clean, the equational `Erases.strengthen_fvlift` is KEPT
--     verbatim (`NoProj`, `Ordered`, `FVWF`, sorryAx-free) beside the new one, and the two
--     scopes are split by consumer:
--       * `erases_strengthen_closed`/`erases_uniform_closed` take `NoProjBinders` and route
--         through the defeq lemma — they have carried that `sorryAx` since `fee3ada`, so
--         nothing moves;
--       * the bridge's recursive exit keeps the equational lemma, because
--         `BlockHyps.block_lam` keeps `NoProj` for the sibling bodies (below).
--     MEASURED: the whole audit is BYTE-IDENTICAL across this slice, all 750 earlier
--     entries, including `Erases.strengthen_fvlift` (three axioms, no `sorryAx`),
--     `visitExpr_refines_erases` (seven) and `rec_exit_refines_erases` (six).
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.Erases.strengthen_fvlift
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.erases_strengthen_closed
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.erases_uniform_closed
--
-- (d) WHERE THE `NoProj` WENT. `DeltaHyps.esrc_shape` now reads `NoProjBinders`; the
--     strong predicate reappears as the second conjunct of `BlockHyps.block_lam`
--     ("a block source is a projection-free λ"), keyed on the recursive exit's own
--     fragment. NOTHING IS NEWLY ASSUMED: it is the same condition `esrc_shape` demanded
--     of every fragment body before this slice, now demanded only of the recursive ones,
--     and lifting it is a follow-on slice whose price is exactly the axiom movement (c)
--     avoids. `BlockHyps.sibling_scope` is where the two bundles' division of labour is
--     machine-checked, and it is the line that would break.

--
-- (e) NON-VACUITY, BOTH POLARITIES AND BOTH LEVELS — the S1d/S1e discipline, applied to a
--     WEAKENING rather than to a new premise. A weakened scope condition is worthless if
--     it admits nothing new, so the guard is the term the slice exists for:
--       * SYNTACTIC, at the design's full `fun α x self => self.1`:
--         `noProjBinders_ofNatBody` holds and `noProj_ofNatBody_refuted` refutes the old
--         predicate on the same term;
--       * ENVIRONMENT-LEVEL, in `esrc_shape`'s own shape and at the EMPTY context:
--         `gEsrcShapeProj` discharges both conjuncts for `MyOfNat.ofNat`'s body over P3's
--         type-class fixture — a real `TrExprS` through a real `TrProj` — and
--         `gEsrcShapeProj_noProj_refuted` is the other half.
--     Without the second, the field would be satisfiable only where the translation
--     conjunct is vacuous, which is exactly the failure the `envFO` version of
--     `gRecEsrcShape` was caught in (Γ-W4(e)).

#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.gEsrcShapeProj_noProj_refuted
--
-- (f) THE RESIDUAL CUT, NAMED. `NoProjBinders` still excludes `let y := self.1; …`: the
--     `letE` clauses stay `NoProj` because `Erases.letE` records BOTH components of the
--     `.vlet` entry and the body's IH runs at a context mentioning them. Lifting that needs
--     the depth-indexed `.vlet` surgery `ErasesUniform`'s section note prices and rejects.
--     It is not a blocker: a prepared class-method body is a λ telescope over a projection,
--     not a `let` over one. And it cannot be lifted by a re-pin either — equational
--     uniqueness at `.proj` is FALSE, not unproved, so the binder clauses are permanent.
--
-- (g) THE CROWN, UNMOVED. Both capstones keep their eight, the bridge its seven,
--     `rec_exit_refines_erases` its six. A slice that admits a whole new class of source
--     terms and changes no axiom set is the outcome (c) was designed for.

--
-- The three slices the P0/P1/P4 audit section recorded as NOT independent, landed
-- together because they never were: `SEvalDataι.proj` is one new constructor and three
-- new arms, and two of those arms are the subject reduction and the simulation.
--
-- (a) THE SOURCE RULE. `reduceProj`: the discriminant evaluates to a saturated spine of
--     the structure's own constructor, and spine position `np + i` is selected and
--     evaluated. THE DESIGN'S `hsel : ∃ h, SEvalDataι …` BUNDLE IS REFUTED — it puts the
--     recursive occurrence under `Exists` and the arm loses its induction hypothesis.
--     `hlt`/`hsel` are two fields, exactly as `iota` splits `hidx` from `hbranch`.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.SEvalDataι
--
-- (b) THE INTERFACE MOVED, AND ONE PLANNED LEMMA DIED WITH IT. `ProjConsistent` now takes
--     the UNREDUCED discriminant plus its subject reduction as a function. The P4 form
--     quantified over the reduced redex, which no consumer holds, and bridging the two
--     was the design's `SEvalDataι_proj_congr` — a `TrProj` congruence under a defeq
--     discriminant. It is NOT NEEDED: `ProjDefeqSpec`, and upstream's `TrEnv.proj_defeq`,
--     already take their discriminant up to definitional equality. The congruence the
--     design wanted to prove is the premise the upstream rule wants to be given.

--
-- (d) THE SIMULATION. `Erases.proj_redex_inv` was never written: `Erases.proj_inv` (P1)
--     IS the two-way split, because `box` and `proj` are the only rules concluding at a
--     projection — no spine arithmetic, no prefix relevance. `ProjRelevant` was not
--     written either: its one surviving clause is `IotaRelevant.ctorValue` with the
--     eliminator hypothesis widened to a disjunction (one field, one use site; nothing in
--     the tree CONSTRUCTS an `IotaRelevant`, so there are no discharge sites to repair).

--     `0` is observable on both sides. `wcbvEval_proj_fires` is the guard the design flags
--     as genuinely new: `LBOptimize_correct`'s non-block `proj` arm is VACUOUS
--     (`simp [defaultFlags] at hb`), so nothing had ever exercised this rule at the flavour
--     the data development runs. `proj_step_fires` is `erases_correct_dataι`'s conclusion

--
-- (g) ⚠️ A DESIGN CLAIM THAT FAILED: `ProjShape` DOES NOT DISCHARGE THE AGREEMENT.
--     §3.1/§3.2 assert that `ival.ctors = [ctor]` supplies `ProjDefeqSpec`'s missing
--     constructor agreement — "the structure has exactly one constructor, so the `TrProj`
--     witness's `ctorName` and the spine's head are the same name". It cannot.
--     `ProjShape` relates `kenv` to `Γ`; the witness's `ctorName` is bound by the
--     `env.pats` membership, i.e. it is a fact about the `VEnv`, which `ProjShape` never
--     mentions. The informal step silently uses a `kenv`↔`env` alignment — which is what
--     a `TrEnv` is, and what the eventual `of_trEnv` will have in hand.
--
--     So the link is NAMED, as `ProjCtorAgree`, in the `PatsIotaSpec`/`ProjDefeqSpec`
--     idiom: a `Prop` hypothesis, never an axiom, refuted at a `pats`-free `env` and with
--     content at `Γproj` (`c = AC.mk`). It is not a new KIND of trust item — it is the
--     `VEnv`-side half of the same `TrEnv.proj_defeq` statement correction this round
--     already escalates upstream.
--
--     `ProjShape` still reaches the arity fact, but only through a `Γ`-side uniqueness
--     side condition (`hone`), which `Γproj_ctorsUnique` discharges by computation. The
--     registration route (`ProjFieldsCoherent`, slice P0) needs neither.

-- SLICE proj-P8 — THE BRIDGE COVERS PROJECTIONS
-- ============================================================================
--
-- The last of the projection round's model-side slices, and the one the P1 report named
-- as the obstruction: `Supported.proj` could not be added independently, because step 1
-- of `visitExpr_refines_erases_core` analyses `hsupp` by a COMPLETE `cases`, and the only
-- thing that can discharge a new arm is motive 10 — whose conclusion was `True`.
--
-- (a) THE FOURTH BUNDLE. Two clauses, one per non-recursive call `visitProj` makes, and
--     between them they pin all three fields of the emitted `ProjectionInfo`. Both are
--     Γ↔environment registration agreements and both are `env`/`Us`-free, so THE
--     PROJECTION BRIDGE ADDS NO TYPING ASSUMPTION — the claim `CasesBridgeHyps` makes for
--     itself, and the one this bundle was shaped to keep. No `ProjInfoAgrees` (visitProj
--     reads no `CasesInfo`), no `inferType` clause (the projection path never η-expands),
--     so nothing here is of `BridgeHyps.orc_run`'s elaborator-correctness class.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.ProjBridgeHyps
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.ProjBridgeHyps.withFixvars
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.ProjBridgeHyps.of_coh
--
-- (b) AND IT IS A THEOREM WHEREVER THE ROUND DOES NOT REACH. Both clauses are keyed on
--     `Γ.projs S = some _`, uninhabited at the default `⊥`, so every context predating the
--     round satisfies the bundle outright. That is what kept the 33 signatures and 34
--     application sites of the threading commit mechanical: they carry a premise that is
--     free at every Γ they instantiate.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.ProjBridgeHyps.of_bot
--
-- (c) THE MASK ARITHMETIC, AND A LIBRARY GAP. `visitProj` computes its field index
--     POST-argmask (`argmasks[0]![:i].toArray.count .keep`) and the model uses `i`; at a
--     trivial mask the two agree, which is where the all-`keep` restriction inherited from
--     `Erases.ctor` is cashed in on the bridge side. It needed its own
--     `count_keep_replicate`: `ConstructorArgRelevance` derives `BEq` but NOT `LawfulBEq`
--     (shipping code, byte-unchanged this round as every round), so the library's
--     count-of-replicate lemmas do not apply and `decide` does not reduce through
--     `Std.Slice.toArray`. The guard is stated with `2 ≠ 3` beside it so it cannot be
--     misread as the degenerate `count = width`.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.count_keep_replicate
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.count_keep_take_replicate
--
-- (d) THE RULE, AND THE INVERSIONS THAT COST NOTHING. Every `Supported` inversion the
--     bridge uses already ended in a catch-all (`const_inv'`, `app_inv''`, `lam_inv`,
--     `letE_inv`, `ctorApp_inv`, `casesApp_inv`, `supported_foldl_app_inv`), so the new
--     constructor was absorbed with no edit at all. The two lemmas that ENUMERATE the
--     constructors — `instantiate1'` and `withFixvars` — gain one line each.

--
-- (e) MOTIVE 10, WITH CONTENT, AND THE STEP. The motive is in the post-Γ-W1 shape
--     (∀ Γ hΓ after the run hypothesis; `RunConclδ` re-indexed to Γ₀; the ⊑ conjunct
--     outside), and it adds exactly ONE IH site — `ih1`, at the local Γ, never the step-6
--     `Γ₀ rfl` column. The admissibility obligation did NOT change:
--     `eraseM_admissible_ok₃` quantifies its `Q` and already named `visitProj` as a client.
--     The step itself is four moves: `projind_run` (state transparency is the THEOREM
--     `run_getConstInfo_state`, so the `unreachable!` arm is dead), `projreg_run` (state
--     effect is the THEOREM `run_register_inductive_runConcl`, not a clause),
--     `count_keep_take_replicate`, and the discriminant's IH.

--
-- (f) WHY STEP 1's ARM IS TEN LINES. A projection's discriminant is a SUBTERM of its
--     redex, so its translation is read straight off `TrExprS.proj` — no application
--     generation, no `HasType.app_inv`. The same structural fact that made P5's discharge
--     shorter than ι's makes the bridge arm shorter than the `casesApp` one.
--
-- (g) BOTH POLARITIES, AND THE P1 GUARD FLIPPED. The P1-era exclusion held at EVERY Γ for
--     a reason that has now expired; restated, it is the ordinary registration gate that
--     `natLit` has (`Γ.projs = ⊥` makes the rule unusable). Positive: `Supported.proj` at
--     `Γproj` over a variable and over a saturated constructor spine.

--
-- (h) THE PAYOFF, AS A GUARD. Guard (v) runs the bridge end to end on
--     `fun (self : MyOfNat N n0) => self.ofNat` — the prepared class-method body whose
--     `Supported` half was the first conjunct `DeltaHyps.prepared` could not satisfy for
--     the typeclass layer. Constructed: `ΓprojQ`, the `BridgeInv`, the `Supported`
--     derivation, and the source translation `trExprSQ_ofNatBody` — the ONE translation in
--     the tree that goes through a `TrProj`. Hypothetical: the run, the four bundles,
--     `DeltaHyps`/`BlockHyps`, and `envQ.Ordered` (`VEnv.Ordered` has no `addPat` clause at
--     this pin — `ProjPattern.lean`'s own note). Every one of those predates the slice.

--
-- The round's last slice, and the only one whose subject is the cold start rather than
-- the model. P5/P6/P7 gave the ι simulation three projection premises; P8 gave the bridge
-- the fourth bundle; both landed with the cold-start ι capstone stated at a
-- STRUCTURE-FREE Γ, because the registry invariant had no `Γ.projs` column and two of the
-- three premises are environment records that have to come off it. This slice grows the
-- column and deletes the restriction.
--
-- (a) THE INVARIANT'S NEW ROW. Two scoped records, `RegisteredProjsOn` and
--     `RegisteredProjCtorFieldsOn`, keyed on `Γ.projs` where `cases`/`fields` are keyed on
--     `Γ.casesOns`, scoped by the same `BlockRegistered s.gdecls`. NOT consequences of the
--     `casesOns` rows: a structure nothing pattern-matches on has `Γ.casesOns = none`
--     everywhere, so those rows are silent about the very block `visitProj` registers —
--     which is the whole reason `ProjFieldsCoherent` is a twin of `CtorFieldsCoherent`

--     `Γ.projs`, cold-branch-guarded like their twins, so `regShapeHyps_regCtors_refuted`'s
--     hit-branch instantiation has nowhere to live — and ONE `satProjs`, not two: both new
--     rows are keyed on the same `Γ.projs` lookup, so one completeness fact collapses both.
--     `RunClosed.regInvShape` threads them; `visitExpr_regInvShape` is unchanged AS A
--     STATEMENT, so every consumer of the shape induction picks the column up for free.
--     That is the coverage-field precedent from S1e repeating exactly.

-- (d) THE COMPOSITION. At the run's final state the two P0 discharges fire on the walked
--     registry: `ErasesEnvProjs` by `erasesEnvProjs_of_registeredProjs`, and
--     `ProjFieldsCoherent` by `projFieldsCoherent_of_registered` — which needs the
--     CONSTRUCTOR record too, so the ι capstone's projection half consumes three of the
--     five columns jointly, the same way its `CtorFieldsCoherent` half consumes three.
--     `hnoprojs : Γ.projs = ⊥` is DELETED from `shipping_erase_correct_firstorderι_coldstart`.

#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.projFieldsCoherent_of_registered
--
-- (e) WHAT SURVIVES AS A PREMISE, AND WHY IT IS NOT AN ENVIRONMENT RECORD. One:
--     `hproj : ProjConsistent env Us Γ`, sitting where `hiota` sits and for the same
--     reason — it is a statement about `env`, so no amount of registry bookkeeping can
--     produce it. Its discharge is `projConsistent_of_coh` on the `ProjFieldsCoherent`
--     the capstone now DERIVES, leaving the two upstream-gated items the round has named
--     since P4/P5: `ProjDefeqSpec` (upstream's `TrEnv.proj_defeq`, a real statement with a
--     deferred proof — commission item A2) and `ProjCtorAgree` (the `env.pats`↔`Γ.ctors`
--     agreement `ProjShape` provably CANNOT supply). Both are `Prop` hypotheses; neither
--     is an axiom, and neither became one here.

#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.projConsistent_of_noProjs
--
-- (f) BOTH POLARITIES AT THE CAPSTONE. Negative: at `ΓprojQ` the deleted premise is
--     REFUTED, not merely unused — the `ΓFOrec_norec_refuted` pattern transposed, and what
--     makes the widening real rather than a re-phrasing. Positive: `ProjFieldsCoherent`
--     holds there NON-DEGENERATELY (`MyOfNat.mk`'s arity 3 = 2 params + 1 field, so a proof
--     confusing `paramCount` with `fieldIdx` would not close), and it is the Γ-side input
--     the `ProjConsistent` discharge runs on. Two premises stop being free at that Γ, which
--     is why the guard is worth running there: `ProjBridgeHyps` can no longer be
--     `of_bot`-instantiated, and `satProjs`'s gate is inhabited (`ΓprojQ_projs`) — the
--     S1d/S1e "satisfiable only vacuously" failure mode, checked for the new column.

-- (g) THE CROWN, UNMOVED — AND THE WHOLE FILE AGAIN. As at P8, the entire inherited prefix
--     is byte-identical after this slice: a structure field added to the registry
--     invariant, three fields added to its bundle, a scope restriction deleted from a
--     capstone, and not one axiom set in the audit changed. The capstones keep their eight,
--     the bridge its seven.

-- ============================================================================
-- THE PROJECTION ROUND, CLOSED — WHAT TEN SLICES BOUGHT
-- ============================================================================
--
-- P0 → P9, measured in this file: the round's six audit landings added 135 entries
-- (+12 at P3, +23 at P0/P1/P4, +22 at P2, +28 at P5/P6/P7, +18 at P8, +32 here), and at
-- every one of them the inherited prefix came back byte-identical.
--
-- What the round bought, in one line each:
--
--   P0  `Γ` grew a projection column; `ProjFieldsCoherent` and the two registration
--       records were stated and discharged at a real fixture.
--   P1  `Erases.proj` — the target rule, and eleven inversion arms that were free.
--   P2  `NoProjBinders` — the typeclass layer stopped being excluded by `esrc_shape`.
--   P3  the λ□ side: `WcbvEval.proj` and its metatheory.
--   P4  `ProjDefeqSpec` — the projection-reduction interface, and the hypothesis upstream
--       is missing.
--   P5/P6/P7  the source rule, its subject reduction, and its simulation — plus the
--       finding that `ProjShape` cannot supply the constructor agreement, hence
--       `ProjCtorAgree`.
--   P8  the bridge: the fourth bundle, motive 10 with content, and `Supported.proj`.
--   P9  the registry composition — and `hnoprojs` dies.
--
-- SO: the whole typeclass-dispatch layer — `Expr.proj` in the source, `.proj` in the
-- target, and the structure registration that links them — is inside the cold-start ι
-- capstone's statement, MODULO exactly two named `Prop` hypotheses, both upstream's and
-- both already on the commission: `TrEnv.proj_defeq` (A2, deferred) reaching us as
-- `ProjDefeqSpec`, and `ProjCtorAgree`, the `env`-side half of the same statement
-- correction. No axiom of ours, no `sorry` of ours, and not a byte of the shipping eraser.

-- ============================================================================
-- SLICE Γ-U — THE UNIVERSE BLOCKER, COSTED AND NOT TAKEN
-- ============================================================================
--
-- The projection round removed §H's first leverage item and made `DeltaHyps.prepared`
-- satisfiable for the class-method BODIES. It did not make `DeltaHyps` inhabitable for
-- the class-method DECLARATIONS: every one of them is universe-polymorphic
-- (`OfNat.ofNat.{u}`, `HAdd.hAdd.{u,v,w}`, `Add.add.{u}`, …) while `decl_run` pins
-- `ci.levelParams = Us` and the capstones run at `Us = []`. This slice was commissioned
-- to relax that pin. It lands NO relaxation — two of its five findings say the relaxation
-- is not the cheap half of a bigger job but the WRONG half — and it lands instead the two
-- facts that make the cost measurable, plus the docstring corrections they force.
--
-- Everything below is analysis carried in `DeltaHyps`' module docstring (the five
-- findings), `SubjectReductionFull`'s `SEnvConsistent` docstring (the provenance
-- correction), and `ColdStart`'s `hUs`/`hcon` ledger rows. Two declarations are new.
--
-- (a) THE MODEL'S δ STEP IS UNIVERSE-BLIND — and this is the finding that decided the
--     slice. Every δ rule in the development binds the call site's levels `us` and then
--     DISCARDS them, unfolding `.const n us` to the UNINSTANTIATED body; the kernel
--     unfolds to `body.instantiateLevelParams ci.levelParams us`. The two agree exactly
--     when the instantiation is the identity, i.e. under the pin this slice was asked to
--     remove. The theorem states "discarded" as a theorem: ONE body evaluation serves
--     EVERY level instantiation of the same constant. `sorryAx`-free, and the cheapest
--     entry in this file.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.SEvalDataι.delta_level_blind
--
-- (b) `SEnvConsistent` COLLAPSES A CONSTANT'S INSTANTIATIONS — the same fact one layer
--     up, and the one that was NOT written down anywhere. The premise quantifies `us` and
--     its conclusion never mentions it, so it forces any two level instantiations of a
--     fragment constant definitionally equal. A well-formed `VEnv` does not supply that:
--     `VEnv.IsDefEq.extra` instantiates BOTH sides of a defining equation, so what a
--     `VEnv` gives is `.const n us ≡ ⟦body⟧.instL us`, never two `instL`s to each other.
--     `SEnvConsistent`'s docstring claimed the un-instantiated form; that claim is
--     corrected in place, and this is its refutation.
--
--     AXIOM ACCOUNTING: it inherits `sorryAx` and inherits it from ONE place —
--     `TrExprS.uniq`, whose set is byte-identical and which `erases_correct_data` and its
--     siblings have consumed since long before this slice. Nothing new enters the
--     development's frontier; the guard is a consumer of an item already paid for.
#print axioms Lean4Lean.TrExprS.uniq
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.SEnvConsistent.levels_collapse
--
-- (c) WHY THE RELAXATION IS THE WRONG HALF. Three further findings, none of them
--     axiom-visible, all of them in `DeltaHyps`' Γ-U section: `prepared` and `esrc_shape`
--     pin the same monomorphism independently of `decl_run`, so relaxing one clause is a
--     no-op; `Us` is a PARAMETER of `visitExpr_refines_erases_core` rather than a motive
--     binder, and the dependency's sub-run is fed to motive 1's own IH, so there is no
--     composition point outside the induction at which an `instL` could be inserted (the
--     Γ-W1 pattern, at Γ-W1 scale — 343 occurrences of `Us` in a 4452-line file); and
--     `DeltaMem`/`RunConclδ` are `Us`-indexed and chained by `.trans`, so the record
--     cannot stay as it is under a `∀ Us` motive. On top of which `TrExprS.instL` lands
--     in `TrExpr`, not `TrExprS`, while `Erases.box`/`lam`/`letE` record STRICT witnesses
--     — so `Erases.instL`, the lemma the whole plan rests on, is the wall and not a
--     corollary. The ι-era `TrExprS.instL_weak` escapes this only by transporting a
--     closed rhs at `Δ = []`; inside an induction over contexts there is no such escape.
--
-- (d) THE FAILURE MODE, WHICH IS THE POINT. Relaxing `decl_run` and `block_lparams`
--     alone would make `DeltaHyps` inhabitable at a polymorphic dependency and leave the
--     capstones with `hcon : SEnvConsistent` false at exactly those constants. Both are
--     vacuity, so no theorem would become unsound — but one is a named, documented scope
--     restriction and the other is an unnamed premise, and trading the first for the
--     second is a regression in legibility of precisely the kind this ledger exists to
--     prevent. That is why the slice stops here.
--
-- (e) THE CROWN, UNMOVED — AND THE WHOLE FILE AGAIN. No signature changed, no premise
--     moved, no fixture was touched; the slice is two theorems and four docstrings. The
--     capstones keep their eight and the bridge its seven, and the entire inherited
--     850-entry prefix comes back byte-identical.

-- ============================================================================
-- SLICE Γ-W5 — MUTUAL BLOCKS: THE LAST SINGLE-DECLARATION RESTRICTION, LIFTED
-- ============================================================================
--
-- Γ-W3.6b made the bridge WALK `visitMutual`'s recursive exit and Γ-W4 stopped the
-- capstones excluding recursion, but both stood on one clause of
-- `DeltaHyps.decl_run`: `ci.all = [m] ∧ remove_unsafe_rec m = n`. Self-recursion only.
-- Every genuine mutual block — in the subject or anywhere in its dependency cone — made
-- the bundle UNINHABITED, the same failure mode Γ-W2 found one level in when the field
-- still read `ci.all = [n]`.
--
-- The relaxed field states the three facts the walk actually consumes:
--
--     (∀ m ∈ ci.all, known (remove_unsafe_rec m)) ∧
--     (ci.all.map remove_unsafe_rec).Nodup ∧
--     n ∈ ci.all.map remove_unsafe_rec
--
-- and they are a RELAXATION, not a trade: the old pair implies them given the field's
-- own `known n` premise. `gDeclRunMutual_of_single` is that implication; the other two
-- guards are the halves that make it worth having. Twenty entries, all clean.
--
-- (a) THE FIELD. The old conjunct is FALSE at a two-member block, and the new one is
--     inhabited there — including the run's own `single_decl` test coming back `false`,
--     which is what sends such a block down the branch step 6 now walks. `gMutualNames`
--     is the measured fetch shape (`[f._unsafe_rec, g._unsafe_rec]`), so this is the
--     Γ-W0 measurement at arity two.

--
-- (b) THE MUTUAL TWIN OF THE `ΓfixRec` FIXTURE, and the reason it had to be built rather
--     than reused. A one-definition block observes NO ordering convention: `defs[0]` is
--     the only def, `fixSubst` has one entry and its reversal is invisible, `closeFix`'s
--     last-sibling-innermost rule has nothing to be last of, and `hreg` has one row. At
--     arity two all four become checkable at once, and `fixMutDefs_unfold_f`/`_g` are
--     where they meet: `f`'s body unfolds to a call of `.fix fixMutDefs 1` and `g`'s to
--     `.fix fixMutDefs 0`, both by `rfl`. Get either convention off by one and those two
--     stop being `rfl`. The block is `def f (a : Prop) := g a` / `def g (a : Prop) := f a`
--     — genuinely mutual, each sibling calling the OTHER, which is the cross-reference
--     `ΓfixRec`'s self-loop cannot exhibit.

--
-- (c) THE WALK, AT THE MUTUAL BLOCK. `rec_exit_refines_erases` and `RecBlockAgreement`
--     were arity-general from the start — that is the whole reason this slice is small —
--     so what had to be shown is that their fragment-side gates are inhabited at two
--     names rather than one. One limitation only became visible here:
--     `bridgeInv_cold_known` is stated at `known = (fun m => m = n)` and cannot express a
--     two-name fragment. It is a specialisation of `bridgeInv_cold_any`, because NO field
--     of `BridgeInv` mentions the fragment at all — the general form is the one a mutual
--     fragment needs, and the old statement is unchanged.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.bridgeInv_cold_any
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.gRecBlockRegisteredMutual
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.gRecAgreementMutual
--
-- (d) THE CAPSTONE SIDE, AS FAR AS IT IS CONSTRUCTIBLE — and where it stops, which is the
--     finding. `hcov : RecCovered` is the premise that replaced `hnorec` at Γ-W4 and it is
--     `env`-free, so it can be COMPUTED at a two-member registration: `gMutCoveredFO`
--     checks both rows at their OWN indices (`f ↦ (fixMutDefs, 0)`, `g ↦ (fixMutDefs, 1)`
--     — swap them and `recConstState_envLookup`'s membership premise fails), over an
--     environment holding THREE distinct keys rather than two (`gMutKeysFO`).
--     `gMutScope` is the fragment-scope half at a two-name `known`.
--
--     What is NOT constructed is the end-to-end capstone, and the obstruction is
--     `hcon : SEnvConsistent`. `envRec_senvConsistent` discharges it by η, because a
--     self-loop's body IS its own constant's η-expansion. A mutual block's is the OTHER
--     member's, so the premise forces `.const f [] ≡ .const g []` — a defeq BETWEEN THE
--     SIBLINGS, stated as a theorem here rather than asserted. It is the sibling-side twin
--     of Γ-U's `levels_collapse`, proved the same way and carrying `sorryAx` from the same
--     single place (`TrExprS.uniq`, which the whole simulation layer has consumed since
--     long before either slice). An `envMut` discharging `hcon` therefore has to declare
--     one member as a kernel definition of the other, degenerating the source side of the
--     fixture; recorded rather than built. It does NOT block the slice: `hcon` is a
--     capstone premise, not a bundle field, so mutual blocks are in scope for the bridge
--     and for `DeltaHyps` either way.

--
-- (d') WHAT THE SLICE DID NOT COST. The multi-declaration arm of step 6 is TEN LINES, and
--     the reason is the shipping eraser's own control flow: at `ci.all.length ≠ 1` the
--     `single_decl` guard skips the whole `@[inline]`/`value?`/`isExtern` prefix, and
--     `nonrecursive` — being `single_decl && …` — is `false` with it, so the run goes
--     straight to the block exit. No inline prefix, no second `getEnv`, no `logInfo`
--     world steps, no axiom exits: the mutual path is SHORTER than the self-recursive
--     one. The single-declaration arm got shorter too, losing the three `have`s that
--     built `hkn'`/`hnd`/`hnmem` out of `ci.all = [mn]`.
--
-- (e) WHAT IT DID NOT BUY, MEASURED. `hcon : SEnvConsistent` and `hUs : Us = []` are
--     untouched, so the §H benchmarks are no closer: their blocker is universe
--     polymorphism (Γ-U), not arity. And the measurement is stronger than that. Reading
--     the arity of every `tFix` block in the five erased programs
--     (`VerifyBench/ast/*.ast`): Arith 4 blocks, Sieve 10, BinaryTrees 10, Quicksort 11,
--     Fannkuch 15, and the defs-per-block histogram is `{1: n}` in EVERY case — not one
--     mutual block among the fifty. So this slice moves ZERO programs into the fragment,
--     which is the Γ-U finding in reverse (a restriction removed rather than costed, with
--     the same null effect on coverage) and is recorded here rather than left to be
--     inferred. It is worth having regardless, for a reason the table cannot show: the
--     restriction was on the whole DEPENDENCY CONE, so one mutual pair anywhere below a
--     program excluded it outright, and nothing was checking. What the slice really
--     removes is a restriction that was invisible in the ledgers precisely because it sat
--     inside a five-conjunct field — the same reason δ-D8e split `nonrecursive` out
--     before trading it.
--
-- (f) THE CROWN, UNMOVED — AND THE WHOLE FILE AGAIN. Twenty-five new declarations plus
--     five crown re-prints (856 → 886), and twenty-four of the twenty-five measure
--     `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` or a subset — two of them only `propext`.
--     The twenty-fifth is `SEnvConsistent.siblings_collapse`, which carries `sorryAx` from
--     exactly one place, `TrExprS.uniq`, byte-identically to its Γ-U twin
--     `levels_collapse`: a consumer of an item paid for long ago, not a new frontier.
--     The capstones keep their eight, `visitExpr_refines_erases` its seven and
--     `rec_exit_refines_erases` its six; and the entire inherited 856-entry prefix comes
--     back byte-identical. One
--     signature was generalised (`bridgeInv_cold_any` beside `bridgeInv_cold_known`) and
--     one field relaxed; no axiom, `sorry` or `native_decide` added, and not a byte of
--     the shipping eraser touched.

-- ============================================================================
-- SLICE Γ-U1 — THE STRICT HALF: WEAKENING ALONG A PREFIX EXTENSION
-- ============================================================================
--
-- Γ-U stopped at analysis and left a four-slice plan of record. This is its first
-- slice, and the one the analysis singled out as provable where the plan's own
-- transport is not: `TrExprS` (and `Erases`) weakened along a PREFIX EXTENSION
-- `Us <+: Us'` of the level scope, with STRICT conclusions.
--
-- THE ASYMMETRY IS THE WHOLE POINT. `TrExprS.instL` — level SUBSTITUTION — lands in
-- `TrExpr`: it re-derives sort and const levels only up to `≈`, and `Erases.box`/`lam`/
-- `letE` record strict `TrExprS` witnesses, so it is the wall (Γ-U3). A prefix EXTENSION
-- substitutes nothing. `VLevel.ofLevel` resolves a parameter by `List.idxOf`, which
-- returns the FIRST occurrence, and a first occurrence inside the prefix does not move
-- when the list grows on the right (`List.findIdx_append`, positive branch). The very
-- same `VLevel` comes back, the derivation transports on the nose, and the conclusion is
-- a `TrExprS`.
--
-- The slice is a lemma kit in ONE NEW FILE, `ErasesLevels.lean`. It relaxes no bundle
-- field, edits no signature, and has no consumer yet — Γ-U2 is what consumes it, and the
-- Γ-U analysis records why Γ-U2 must not ship alone. Everything below is `sorryAx`-free.
--
-- (a) INDEX STABILITY — the prefix-specific half. `ofLevel` succeeds at `Us'` wherever it
--     succeeded at `Us`, WITH THE SAME `VLevel`. The `<` premise of the `param` arm is
--     `ofLevel`'s own membership test, which is why the append lemma is stated with it
--     rather than with `n ∈ l`.
#print axioms Lean4Lean.List.idxOf_append_of_lt
#print axioms Lean4Lean.VLevel.ofLevel_prefix
#print axioms Lean4Lean.VLevel.mapM_ofLevel_prefix
--
-- (b) UNIVERSE-COUNT MONOTONICITY — the half with nothing to do with prefixes, and the
--     one that was not in the plan at all. `TrExprS` carries `env.HasType Us.length …`
--     and `env.IsType Us.length …` side premises and a `TrProj env Us.length …` arm, so
--     the transport needs the typing judgement to survive a LONGER scope. It does:
--     `IsDefEq` mentions its `uvars` argument at exactly three constructors — `sortDF`,
--     `constDF`, `extra` — and in each only as `VLevel.WF uvars`, which is a conjunction
--     of `i < n` conditions on `param` leaves. Every other rule is `uvars`-blind, so the
--     induction is structural and premise-free: no `env.WF`, no `Ordered`, no `OnCtx`.

--
-- (c) THE BOX ARM, RESOLVED HERE AND NOT AT Γ-U3 — the timeboxed risk, which did not
--     materialise. The commission flagged `Erases.box`'s `Erasable env Us.length Δ.toCtx
--     ve` as the place a `VExpr`-side wall might live, and asked for the gap to be stated
--     precisely if it appeared. There is no gap. Unfolded, `Erasable` is a `HasType`
--     together with a `HasType`-or-`IsArityUpTo` disjunct, and all three are `IsDefEq` at
--     `U`; `IsArity` itself never mentions `U`. So `Erasable.uvars_mono` is a corollary
--     of (b) with NO environment-side lift and NO context condition — the answer to
--     "does `Erasable` weaken along more levels?" is yes, unconditionally.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.IsArityUpTo.uvars_mono
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.Erasable.uvars_mono
--
-- (d) THE TWO CONCLUSIONS. `TrExprS.prefix_weaken` is the lemma the slice was
--     commissioned for, and it is STRICT — `TrExprS` in, `TrExprS` out. `TrExpr` follows
--     for free (its residual `IsDefEqU` travels by (b)), and is stated for the Γ-U2
--     consumer, which meets `TrExpr` wherever an upstream `instL` has already fired.
--
--     THE `VLCtx` SIDE NEVER ENTERS. `Us` and `Δ` are orthogonal parameters of `TrExprS`;
--     `Δ.toCtx` does not mention `Us`, and the `bvar`/`fvar` arms are pure `VLCtx.find?`
--     lookups. So the family carries no `VLCtx.WF`, no closedness and no freshness
--     premise — which is what distinguishes it from every other transport in the
--     development (`weakBV`, `weakFV`, `abstract`, `instL_weak` all need one).

-- (e) `Erases` ITSELF, confirming the Γ-U analysis's finding (a) by construction. The
--     relation mentions `Us` at exactly three constructors and the target `t` never, so
--     the induction is fifteen structural arms plus the three transports above. Same
--     source, same target, same `VExpr` witnesses, no side conditions.
--
--     This is NOT `Erases.instL`. That one is still the wall, and still Γ-U3.

-- (f) THE GUARDS, POSITIVE — a real scope extension through the real lemma, at every
--     layer. `[u]` extended to `[u, v]`: the parameter resolves to `VLevel.param 0` on
--     BOTH sides (index stability, decided); the `TrExprS` fixture is a sort, which is
--     the constructor that pins the `VLevel` on the nose; the `Erases` fixture is a `lam`
--     whose binder type is that sort, which is one of the three arms that carry a strict
--     `TrExprS`. Both fixtures are built at an ARBITRARY `env`/`Γ`/`Δ`, so what they
--     check is the level scope and nothing else.

-- (g) THE GUARDS, NEGATIVE — the hypothesis is not slack. The commission asked for the

--     refutation. A PERMUTATION preserves the parameter set AND the scope length — it
--     satisfies everything (b) needs — and still breaks the lemma, because `idxOf`
--     returns a position and not a name: `u` sits at `0` in `[u, v]` and at `1` in
--     `[v, u]`. Two refutations, at the level layer and at the `TrExprS` layer, the
--     second at EVERY environment. They are the machine-checked reason
--     `VLevel.ofLevel_prefix` says `<+:` and not "same names".

-- ============================================================================
-- SLICE Γ-U2 — THE PINS, IN PREFIX FORM
-- ============================================================================
--
-- Γ-U1's kit had no consumer. This is it: the four scope pins the Γ-U plan of record
-- names — `BridgeInv.lparams`, `DeltaHyps.decl_run`'s last conjunct,
-- `BlockHyps.block_lparams`, and `BridgeHyps.orc_run`'s guard — now read
-- `ci.levelParams <+: Us` where they read `= Us`.
--
-- THE SLICE'S OWN CONDITION, MET. The plan said Γ-U2 must not ship alone if it TRADES a
-- named restriction for vacuity. It does not, and the reason is arithmetic: at `Us = []`
-- — where every capstone runs, by `ColdStart`'s `hUs` row — `Lp <+: []` holds exactly
-- when `Lp = []`, which IS the old pin. So no shipped instantiation weakened, no field
-- became easier, and nothing moved to `SEnvConsistent`. The widening is real only at a
-- polymorphic SUBJECT, and no capstone states one.
--
-- WHAT IT BUYS AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. Buys: a polymorphic subject calling dependencies
-- declared at a prefix of its scope (every monomorphic callee of a `{u}`-polymorphic
-- caller). Does not buy: a polymorphic dependency of a closed subject — `[u] <+: []` is
-- false, and one constructor deeper the body has no `TrExprS` at `Us = []` at all. That
-- is the typeclass layer, and it needs instantiation (Γ-U3/Γ-U4), not weakening.
--
-- (a) THE PINS' CONSUMERS. `BridgeInv.withFixvars` takes the prefix in its `hlp` slot;
--     the bridge and the recursive exit consume it unchanged. Byte-identical sets: the
--     relaxation needed NO proof repair, because the reader's `lparams` reaches the
--     bridge's proof only through the oracle's guard.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.BridgeInv.withFixvars
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.visitExpr_refines_erases
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.rec_exit_refines_erases
--
-- (b) THE ORACLE DISCHARGE — the one place the slice costs anything, and it is paid in
--     the open. `orc_run`'s soundness clause is CONTRAVARIANT in `TrExprS` and COVARIANT
--     in `Erasable`, so the Γ-U1 kit (which transports upward only) cannot move it in
--     either direction: relaxing its guard is a strictly larger trust item. So
--     `ResidualHyps.orc_refl`'s KERNEL disjunct now carries `ctx.lparams = Us` as a
--     conjunct — the verified relevance check covers a run at the ambient scope, and a
--     strictly narrower reader falls to the assumed-sound `Meta` fallback. At `Us = []`
--     the conjunct is free, so the verified branch covers exactly what it did before.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.ResidualHyps.toBridgeHyps
--
-- (c) THE ARITHMETIC GUARDS — the three that decide "relaxation, not vacuity". The
--     degeneracy at the empty scope, the widening at a non-empty one, and the refutation
--     that bounds the claim.

--
-- (d) THE CONTENT GUARDS — and the correction to the Γ-U analysis' finding (b). That
--     finding said `prepared`/`esrc_shape` pin the same restriction at the ambient `Us`,
--     so relaxing `decl_run` alone is a no-op. True for the INSTANTIATION reading it was
--     written for; false here — a producer proves the own-scope form and
--     `TrExprS.prefix_weaken` carries it to `Us` STRICTLY. This is where Γ-U1 is actually
--     consumed, and it is satisfiability, not proof repair. The negative twin is sharp:
--     at `Us = []` a body mentioning `u` has no `TrExprS` at all, so the typeclass layer
--     is excluded by the RELATION and not by the bundle. The `Erases`-layer guard is the
--     same story one level up, at an arbitrary `env`/`Γ`.

-- (e) THE CROWN, UNMOVED — AND THE WHOLE INHERITED FILE, BYTE-IDENTICAL. The slice edits
--     four signatures, one trust bundle and one discharge proof, and the 910-entry prefix
--     came back UNCHANGED, verified by diffing a full run against a run at `256a047`.

-- ============================================================================
-- SLICE Γ-U3 — LEVEL INSTANTIATION, STRICTLY (THE FLAGGED RISK)
-- ============================================================================
--
-- Γ-U named `Erases.instL` THE WALL: upstream's `TrExprS.instL` lands in `TrExpr`, not
-- `TrExprS`, while `Erases.box`/`lam`/`letE` record strict witnesses and a defeq-loose
-- binder type breaks the sub-derivation's context chain — "inside an induction over
-- contexts there is no composition point".
--
-- THE REASONING WAS RIGHT AND THE CONCLUSION TOO BROAD. `TrExprS.instL`'s residue is
-- manufactured by ONE lemma, `substParams_wf`, and that lemma is strict at three of its
-- five arms: `zero` and `param` produce their `≈` by `rfl` and `succ` is a congruence.
-- Every non-trivial residue comes from `max`/`imax`, and there ONLY because
-- `Level.substParams'` calls Lean's NORMALISING smart constructors
-- `mkLevelMax'`/`mkLevelIMax'`. Level substitution is defeq-loose because it NORMALISES,
-- not because it substitutes. Exclude those two nodes — `NoMaxLevel` / `NoMaxLevels` —
-- and the tower goes strict, `Erases.instL` follows by a plain structural induction, and
-- no composition point is needed because there is no residue to compose.
--
-- The fragment is the intended one: `Sort u`, `Type u`, `List.{u}`, `Nat`, and
-- `OfNat.ofNat.{u}`'s prepared body `fun α x self => self.1` — the typeclass-dispatch
-- layer Γ-U exists to admit — are all `max`/`imax`-free.
--
-- (a) THE LEVEL LAYER — where the residue lives. `substParams_strict` is the strict twin
--     of upstream's `substParams_wf`; `substParams_strict_list` is its spine form. Note
--     the axiom sets: the level layer needs `Lean.Level.hasParam_eq` (lean4lean's model
--     axiom for the opaque `Level.data` bit `substParams'` branches on) and nothing else.
#print axioms Lean4Lean.mapM_ofLevel_getElem?

--
-- (b) THE `TrExprS` LAYER, STRICT — and PREMISE-LIGHT, which is the second finding.
--     Upstream's `TrExprS.instL` needs `VEnv.WF env` and `VLCtx.WF env ls'.length Δ`, the
--     latter to run the defeq-composing `TrExpr.*` smart constructors. The strict version
--     needs NEITHER: every arm is the raw `TrExprS` constructor applied to
--     `instL`-transported side premises. That matters beyond economy — `Erases.lam`
--     carries a `TrExprS` for its binder type and not an `IsType`, so the extended
--     context of its sub-derivation is NOT known to be `VLCtx.WF`, and a transport that
--     demanded it could not have been threaded through `Erases` at all.

--
-- (c) THE BOX ARM's `VExpr` OBLIGATIONS — as at Γ-U1, no environment-side lift: `Erasable`
--     is a `HasType` plus a `HasType`-or-`IsArityUpTo` disjunct and `instL` transports
--     each. `sorryAx`-free and axiom-light (no `Expr` model involved at all).

--
-- (d) `Erases.instL` — THE WALL, ON THE FRAGMENT. The target LBTerm is UNCHANGED, which is
--     the Γ-U analysis' finding (a) proved rather than predicted. `instL_core` is the
--     `instantiateLevelParamsCore'` form and carries the smaller axiom set; `instL` is the
--     `Expr.instantiateLevelParams` wrapper and inherits the `Expr`-model axioms of
--     `Expr.instantiateLevelParams_eq` (including the two `bv_decide` natives the lakefile
--     already records). `Γ.recBodies = ⊥` scopes out the two recursive arms — see (f).

--
-- (e) THE POSITIVE GUARD — the shape Γ-U4 consumes, and the one the Γ-U analysis recorded
--     as unavailable: a `{u}`-POLYMORPHIC dependency body, instantiated at a CLOSED level,
--     landing as an `Erases` derivation at `Us = []` — the capstones' own scope. Same
--     target, no residue, at an arbitrary `env` and any `Γ` without recursive constants.
--     This is the half Γ-U2's prefix explicitly cannot reach (`[u] <+: []` is false).
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.gInstLClosed
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.gErasesInstLClosed
--
-- (f) THE NEGATIVE GUARDS — the plan's route (b), answered in both directions. The
--     commission asked: does `VLevel.ofLevel` on a closed level ignore `Us`, and does the
--     closed-instL transport therefore go strict? The first is YES and is
--     `ofLevel_param_free`. The second is NO and `instL_closed_not_strict` is the
--     counterexample: at `ps = [p]`, `ls = [0]` — as closed as an instantiation gets — the
--     source level `max p 0` substitutes to `0`, while the strict conclusion demands
--     `max 0 0`. Equivalent, not equal, exactly as `substParams_wf` says. Closedness is
--     not the cut; `max`-freeness is, and the two are orthogonal.
--     `mkLevelMax'_zero_zero` is the normalisation itself, proved through the
--     `mkLevelMaxCore` if-chain (`Lean.Level.instLawfulBEqLevel`, already in the bridge's
--     inherited set via `ResidualHyps.toBridgeHyps`).
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.ofLevel_param_free
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.mkLevelMax'_zero_zero
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.instL_closed_not_strict
--
-- (g) WHAT IS STILL OUT, NAMED. The recursive arms, and not for the wall's reason:
--     `Erases.fix`'s `hbodies` premise is `∀ Δf`, while the induction hypothesis supplies
--     the instantiated body only at contexts in the IMAGE of `VLCtx.instL`, which is not
--     every context. Closing it needs `erases_weak_any` and its premises (`Γ.fixvars = ⊥`,
--     source closedness, target `LBClosed`) at each sibling body. That is the one place
--     the analysis' "no composition point" instinct really does bite, and it is scoped out
--     by a named premise rather than hidden.
--
-- (h) THE CROWN, UNMOVED — AND THE WHOLE INHERITED FILE AGAIN. Like Γ-U1, this slice adds
--     one file and one import line and edits no existing declaration; unlike Γ-U1 it has
--     the fixture its consumer will need. The 923-entry prefix comes back byte-identical.

-- ============================================================================
-- SLICE Γ-U4 — THE MODEL PAIR: THE δ RULE INSTANTIATES, AND THE PREMISE SAYS SO
-- ============================================================================
--
-- Γ-U's finding (e) was that the model's δ step is UNIVERSE-BLIND — every δ rule binds the
-- call site's `us` and then discards it, unfolding to the uninstantiated body — while a
-- real `VEnv` supplies `.const n us ≡ ⟦body⟧.instL us` (`VEnv.IsDefEq.extra` instantiates
-- BOTH sides). So `SEnvConsistent` was the kernel fact only at a monomorphic constant, and
-- at a polymorphic one it was a stronger, false demand that collapses the constant's
-- instantiations. This slice repairs both halves.
--
-- (a) WHERE `Ups` LIVES, AND WHY IT COST NOTHING. `ErasureCtx.lparams : Name → List Name`,
--     defaulted `fun _ => []`. The two alternatives were measured and rejected: an
--     `Esrc`-side pairing moves every `Esrc n = some body` site, a new parameter of the
--     evaluation relations moves all 110 `SEvalDataι Γ ia E` occurrences. A DEFAULTED `Γ`
--     column moves nothing — four positional `⟨…⟩` literals in guard `example`s were the
--     entire literal cost — and `Γ` is already in scope at both rules that read the map and
--     already stores every other per-name kernel datum the model reads (`ctorArities`,
--     `ctorFields`, `casesDiscrPos`).
--
--     The equation that makes the slice cheap is `instantiateLevelParams_nil`, and it is
--     `rfl`: `Expr.instantiateLevelParams` short-circuits on `paramNames.isEmpty`, and the
--     left disjunct reduces WITHOUT looking at the call site's levels. So at the default
--     column the restated rule and the restated premise ARE the old ones, definitionally,
--     and finding (d)'s predicted ripple through `DeltaMem`/`RunConclδ`/
--     `ErasesEnvDeltaData`/`RecEnvConsistent`/`ColdStartDelta` never started.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.instantiateLevelParams_nil
#print axioms ErasureCtx.withFixvars_lparams
--
-- (b) THE δ RULE. `SEvalDataι.delta` unfolds at
--     `body.instantiateLevelParams (Γ.lparams n) us` — the kernel's step. Only this
--     relation moved, and the choice is recorded rather than defaulted: `SEval`,
--     `SEvalβδ`, `SEvalβζδ`, `SEvalβζδι`, `SEvalData` and `SEvalDataC` have no `Γ` to read
--     the map from, no ι rule and no capstone, while `SEvalDataι` has all three and its
--     subject reduction reads the consistency premise DIRECTLY (no forgetful map to
--     `SEvalβζδ`). `delta_mono` is the degeneracy every producer goes through;
--     `delta_level_blind` is Γ-U's guard restated — the blindness of the others, and of
--     this rule only under `Γ.lparams n = []`; `delta_level_polymorphic` is the refutation
--     that makes the premise non-cosmetic (at `{u}` the reducts of `us = [0]` and
--     `us = [1]` really differ).

#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.SEvalDataι.delta_level_blind
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.SEvalDataι.delta_level_polymorphic
--
-- (c) THE PREMISE. `SEnvConsistentL env Us Ups Esrc` is `VEnv.IsDefEq.extra`'s conclusion
--     on the source side; `SEnvConsistent` is its `Ups = fun _ => []` instance ON THE NOSE
--     (`senvConsistent_iff_l` is `Iff.rfl`), which is the machine-checked form of "the old
--     premise was the kernel fact restricted to a monomorphic fragment". `toL`/`toMono`
--     are the two one-line conversions the consumers take, and they are why not one of the
--     four `SEnvConsistent` discharges (`envδ_senvConsistent`, `envRec_senvConsistent`,
--     `gRecSEnvConsistent`, `SEnvConsistent.walked`) moved.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.senvConsistent_iff_l
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.SEnvConsistent.toL
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.SEnvConsistentL.toMono
--
-- (d) THE COLLAPSE, REFRAMED. `SEnvConsistentL.levels_collapse` carries `hlp : Ups n = []`
--     explicitly, which says what the repair is for: THE COLLAPSE IS THE PRICE OF THE
--     MONOMORPHISM CLAIM, not of the predicate. Drop `hlp` and the proof does not go
--     through — the two `TrExprS`es are then translations of two different expressions, so
--     `TrExprS.uniq` has nothing to say. `SEnvConsistent.levels_collapse` keeps its old
--     signature and becomes the `Ups = ⊥` corollary; its entry above is unchanged, which is
--     part of the byte-identical prefix claim.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.SEnvConsistentL.levels_collapse
--
-- (e) THE ERASURE-SIDE CLAUSE, AND `Erases.instL`'s FIRST CONSUMER. The δ case of
--     `erases_correct_dataι` needs the recorded target body to erase the INSTANTIATED
--     source body; `ErasesEnvDeltaData` does not say that. `ErasesEnvDeltaL` does, and it
--     quantifies the target body OUTSIDE the call site's levels — one target serves every
--     instantiation, which is finding (a) (λ□ is level-free) as a statement rather than a
--     hope. `.toL` is the monomorphic degeneracy (one line, keeps every capstone green);
--     `.of_ownScope` is the content: from the dependency's erasure at ITS OWN level scope,
--     which is what `visitMutual` produces under
--     `withReader (… lparams := ci.levelParams)`, the Γ-U3 transport lands it at the
--     caller's scope with the target unchanged. Note the axiom sets: `.of_ownScope`
--     inherits `Erases.instL`'s `Expr`-model set (`Expr.instantiateLevelParams_eq` and the
--     two `bv_decide` natives the lakefile already records), and nothing else.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.ErasesEnvDeltaData.toL
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.ErasesEnvDeltaL.of_ownScope
--
-- (f) THE COHERENCE OBLIGATION, CONSTRUCTED AND REFUTED. `LparamsArity` is the fact the
--     column cannot state for itself: it declares the constant at the arity the ENVIRONMENT
--     does. `gLparamsArity_poly` builds it at a `{u}`-declared constant;
--     `gLparamsArity_bot_refuted` shows it is NOT free at the default column — a `Γ` saying
--     `g` is monomorphic while `env` declares it at one universe parameter fails it. That
--     refutation is the exact configuration in which the OLD, level-blind rule silently
--     modelled an unfolding the kernel never performs.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.gLparamsArity_poly
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.gLparamsArity_bot_refuted
--
-- (g) THE POSITIVE GUARDS — the shape Γ-U4 exists for, one layer up from Γ-U3's.
--     `gErasesDeltaInstL` is `gErasesInstLClosed` with the level list read off the universe
--     column instead of written by hand, i.e. the step the restated δ rule takes.
--     `gSEvalDeltaPoly` is the δ STEP itself: `g.{0}` evaluates to the identity at `Sort 0`
--     and `g.{1}` to the identity at `Sort 1` — two instantiations, two values, which the
--     rule this slice replaced could not distinguish.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.gErasesDeltaInstL
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.gSEvalDeltaPoly
--
-- (h) WHAT IS STILL OUT, NAMED — three things, each a premise rather than a silence.
--     (i) `hrecmono` on `erases_correct_dataι`: a `Γ`-RECURSIVE fragment constant is
--     monomorphic, because `Erases.instL` refutes rather than transports its two recursive
--     arms (Γ-U3's `∀ Δf` gap). (ii) `hlp` on `SEvalDataι_defeq_of_shape`: the ι DISCHARGE
--     route δ-unfolds a `casesOn` and then reasons about the uninstantiated recursor value,
--     so lifting it means restating `IotaShape`. (iii) `ColdStartDelta` builds its δ record
--     at the ambient `Us`, so `.of_ownScope`'s input is not yet produced by a cold start —
--     that is the campaign's completion criterion, and it is what the capstones'
--     `hlp : Γ.lparams = ⊥` row stands in for meanwhile.
--
--     `NoMaxLevels` was MEASURED rather than assumed: over the value-cone of two
--     `VerifyBench` programs plus the dispatch heads, 48 of 52 constants with values are
--     `max`-free, the four exceptions are `Nat.below`/`List.below` (`Sort`-valued, so a use
--     site is `Erases.box`) and `Nat.brecOn.go`/`List.brecOn.go`, and NONE of the four
--     occurs in any of the five committed `VerifyBench/ast/*.ast` files.
--
-- (i) THE CROWN, UNMOVED. The slice edits real signatures — the ι simulation's `hcon` and
--     two new premises, the ι capstone's `hlp` row, `SEvalDataι`'s δ constructor — so the
--     byte-identical prefix here is earned the Γ-U2 way and not the Γ-U1 way.

-- SLICE proj-R2 — THE ROUND-2 RE-PIN: ONE GATE CLOSES, ONE GETS A PRICE TAG
-- ============================================================================
--
-- The `b6a5a38` re-pin of `barabbs/lean4lean` (2026-08-28) answers `upstream-round2.md`.
-- It discharges NO upstream `sorry`, adds NO `axiom` (71, identical list) and leaves the
-- 15 `IOTA-TODO` / 4 `PROJ-TODO` markers where they were. Both upstream builds are green
-- (`lake build`, `lake build Lean4Lean.Experimental`).
--
-- (a) THE PREFIX. Every one of the 962 entries above came back BYTE-IDENTICAL across the
--     re-pin AND across this slice's discharges — the strongest form of the claim, and
--     here it is earned the Γ-U1 way for the audit and the Γ-U2 way for the code: three
--     declarations were DELETED from `ProjPattern.lean` (below), which is a real edit to a
--     file the prefix measures, and nothing moved anyway. In particular
--     `Lean4Lean.TrProjCtor.toTrProj` and `Lean4Lean.TrProj.exists_ctorName` still print
--     `[propext]` — the same set — because they are now UPSTREAM's declarations with the
--     same statements and equivalent proofs. The four crown theorems did not move.
--
-- (b) ASK 1 — THE STATEMENT CORRECTION LANDED; THE PROOF DID NOT.
--     `TrEnv.proj_defeq` is re-stated over a new upstream `TrProjCtor`, so the ι rule's
--     constructor and the spine's head are finally the same name. This is exactly what
--     slice P4 escalated ("plausibly UNPROVABLE, not merely unproved") and upstream
--     adopted the correction CHARACTER-IDENTICAL to the copy this repo carried — which is
--     why `ProjPattern.lean`'s `TrProjCtor`, `TrProjCtor.toTrProj` and
--     `TrProj.exists_ctorName` are deleted here: the mirror is upstream's now, and a
--     downstream mirror that outlives its adoption is a duplicate-declaration error, which
--     is precisely how the re-pin announced itself.
--
--     The PROOF is still `sorry` (`Verify/Environment/Lemmas.lean:652`). Upstream
--     re-analysed the residual and it is NOT the ι `pat_uniq` gap: it is a `safety` side
--     condition, the ctor-arity threading `np + nf = rval.numParams + rule.nfields`, and
--     the fact that `rval` is a STRUCTURE recursor — the ι pattern records only the sum
--     `numMotives + numMinors + numIndices`, so `(1,1,0)` is not recoverable from it.
--     That is the inductive-translation-boundary correspondence `VInductDecl.WF` does not
--     pin, and it is the same wall that blocked ask 2b.
--
--     So P4's `of_trEnv` IS LANDED, and it is this file's first and only `sorryAx`
--     provenance from the projection round. It is landed to PRICE the deferral, not to
--     cross it: no capstone uses it, `ProjDefeqSpec` stays a named premise everywhere, and
--     the entry below is the whole cost of accepting upstream's deferred proof.
--
--     [SUPERSEDED at `6fd8a1d` — see §MIGRATION. The deferral was PAID: upstream proved
--     `proj_defeq` by the very route this paragraph's residual analysis implied, taking
--     the `(1,1,0)` split from the kernel's structure facts instead of from the ι
--     pattern's sum. `of_trEnv` is now a real discharge; what it prints is inherited from
--     `patsStrong`/injectivity/unique typing, not from a projection-specific gap. The two
--     conversion probes are gone with their declarations.]

--
-- (c) ASK 2 — DELIVERED AS 2a, AND IT IS ENOUGH. `TrEnv.pats_iota_inv`, the converse of
--     `pats_iota'`, came back FULLY PROVED and `sorryAx`-FREE. Its set is `pats_iota'`'s
--     three `PersistentHashMap` `ConstMap` modelling axioms plus the standard three, and
--     `findAux_isSome` is NOT new to this development — it already occurs in the prefix
--     above, so the re-pin widens the axiom surface by NOTHING.
--
--     The 2b specialization (`pats_iota_ctor`, `cName ∈ ival.ctors`) was NOT landed, for
--     the wall in (b). The ask sanctioned the fallback in advance, and this is it:
--     `ProjCtorAgree` is now a THEOREM, `projCtorAgree_of_trEnv`, from a `TrEnv` plus
--     `ProjRecRules` — and it is `sorryAx`-free.
--
--     ⚠️ READ THE TRADE HONESTLY. The fact did not evaporate; it MOVED. Slice P6's finding
--     was that the agreement is a fact about the `VEnv` that no downstream certificate can
--     reach. It is now a fact about `kenv` — the class `ProjShape`'s `find?` conjuncts
--     already are, in-logic unconstructible for the same documented reason and a kernel
--     well-formedness triviality for a real structure (`S.rec` has one rule per
--     constructor; a structure has one constructor). What the re-pin bought is that the
--     obligation is now STATABLE where the development can see it, and FREE wherever the
--     projection column is (`projRecRules_of_noProjs`) — which is what makes it a trade
--     rather than a new assumption, the same measurement `ProjBridgeHyps.of_bot` earns.
-- [`TrEnv.pats_iota_inv` was DELETED at `6fd8a1d` and replaced by
--  `pats_iota_inv_shape`, which returns the named-witness `TrEnv'.IotaRule` structure
--  instead of a six-component tuple. The probe follows the successor. See §MIGRATION.]

--
-- (d) ASK 3 — NOT DELIVERED, AS PREDICTED. `IsDefEqU.weakN_iff`'s forward direction is
--     untouched (`UniqueTyping.lean:172`), and round 2's analysis agrees with round 1's:
--     the `trans` case's middle term is not a lift, eliminating it needs confluence, and
--     confluence sits downstream of `weakN_iff` both by module import and by a
--     same-measure logical cycle. `hstr : ErasableStrengthen env Us` stays the ledger's
--     single class-R residue. NOTHING to print: no declaration moved.
--
-- (e) THE GUARD, AND WHAT IT MEASURES. `gProjConsistentQ_of_trEnv` fires the new route at
--     the round's own fixture: `ProjConsistent env [] ΓprojQ` from a `TrEnv`, the kernel
--     certificate, and the CONSTRUCTED `ΓprojQ_projFieldsCoherent`, so the shrink is
--     measured rather than asserted. The capstone guard at `ProjectionGuard` deliberately
--     keeps `hagree` hypothetical — it is the general `VEnv`-level statement — which is
--     why both guards exist.
--
--     ⚠️ READ THE TWO COMPOSED SETS CORRECTLY. `projConsistent_of_coh_trEnv` and this
--     guard print `sorryAx`, and it is NOT `of_trEnv`'s — neither of them mentions
--     `of_trEnv`, and both still take `ProjDefeqSpec` as a HYPOTHESIS. It is the
--     PRE-EXISTING inherited unique-typing item that `projConsistent_of_arity` and
--     `projConsistent_of_coh` have carried since slice P5 (their sets in the prefix above
--     are `[propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, byte-identical and unmoved).
--     What the new pair ADDS to that base is exactly the three `ConstMap` modelling
--     axioms that arrive with `pats_iota_inv` — all three already in the prefix. So the
--     discharge widens nothing: no new axiom, no new `sorry`, no new trust of any kind.
#print axioms LeanToLambdaBox.gProjConsistentQ_of_trEnv
--
-- (f) THE LEDGER MOVEMENT, EXACTLY. `hproj`'s row goes from TWO upstream-gated items to
--     ONE. It does NOT die, and it is not demoted: `projConsistent_of_coh` still needs
--     `ProjDefeqSpec`, whose implementation is still `sorry`, so removing `hproj` from the
--     ι cold-start capstone would bury a deferred upstream proof inside the crown instead
--     of naming it. That is the `hnoprojs` precedent read correctly — `hnoprojs` died
--     because the walk DERIVED what it stood in for, and nothing derives `proj_defeq`.
--     Class-R count is unchanged at one (`hstr`).
--
-- (g) THE CROWN, UNMOVED — and this time the byte-identical prefix covers a re-pin, three
--     deleted declarations and six new ones.

-- ############################################################################
-- §MIGRATION — the `6fd8a1d` re-pin (2026-09-09)
-- ############################################################################
--
-- lean4lean was re-pinned `b6a5a38` → `6fd8a1d` (head of the fork's `trproj` branch,
-- 22 commits, 60 files, +17454/-1840). The step absorbs TWO redesigns at once: the ι
-- redesign (branch `iota`, merged in) and a second TrProj redesign on top of it —
-- `b6a5a38` was NOT a descendant of the ι work, so none of it had been seen here.
-- Toolchain unchanged (v4.33.0-rc2), batteries unchanged.
--
-- THIS SECTION IS A REWRITE, NOT A RENUMBERING. The marker taxonomy the entries above
-- are organised around no longer exists upstream:
--
--     IOTA-TODO   15 → 0        PROJ-TODO   4 → 0
--
-- Thirteen of the fifteen were PROVED; one was restated as an explicit caller hypothesis
-- (`VEnv.toParams` now takes `DefEqsAsPats`); one was deleted with the API it guarded.
-- The residue is ONE named theorem, `VEnv.WF.patsStrong` (`Theory/Typing/EnvLemmas.lean`)
-- — "subject reduction of every registered ι rule in every well-formed prefix of `env`".
--
-- (a) THE FOUR ROOT CAUSES, RE-PARTITIONED. The count of *items* drops from ~23 to 7;
--     the count of independent root causes stays 4:
--
--       i    `VEnv.WF.patsStrong`                  (one, named — replaces the 15 markers)
--       ii   `Theory/Typing/Injectivity.lean` ×3   (unchanged: sort_inv,
--                                                   forallE_inv_stratified, sort_forallE_inv)
--       iii  `IsDefEqU.weakN_iff` forward          (unchanged — commission item C1 again
--                                                   NOT delivered; `UniqueTyping.lean` is
--                                                   byte-identical, so `ErasableStrengthen`
--                                                   stays this ledger's class-R residue)
--       iv   `TrProj.weak'_inv` + `TrProj.uniq`    (the A3 residue, two of seven)
--
--     GONE from the list: the whole `TrProj` definitional cluster (`TrProj` is a real
--     definition and 6 of its 7 structural lemmas are proved, plus a new `mono`), and
--     `Aligned.addInduct`, which is PROVED — so `TrEnv'.constMap_wf`, which existed only
--     to route around it, was deleted upstream. The commission's routing rule
--     ("go through `constMap_wf`, NOT `map_wf`") is INVERTED: `map_wf` is the only route
--     and it is clean.
--
-- (b) THE PROJECTION ROW: AN ASSUMPTION BECAME A THEOREM.
--     `TrEnv.proj_defeq` is PROVED (`Verify/Environment/Lemmas.lean`, a file with zero
--     `sorry`s), by the route §(b) of the `b6a5a38` section above predicted when it
--     analysed the residual: take the recursor's `(1 motive, 1 minor, 0 indices)` split
--     from the KERNEL's structure facts (`TrEnv.structure_rec`: `ival.all = [S]`,
--     `ival.ctors = [c]`, `ival.numIndices = 0`) rather than trying to recover it from the
--     ι pattern's sum. `ProjDefeqSpec` is restated at those premises and
--     `ProjDefeqSpec.of_trEnv` is a real discharge.
--
--     ⚠️ IT STILL PRINTS `sorryAx`, AND THE PROVENANCE IS WHAT CHANGED. Before, the
--     `sorryAx` was `proj_defeq`'s OWN deferred proof — a projection-specific gap, priced
--     deliberately and used by nothing. Now it is INHERITED, from unique typing,
--     Π-injectivity and `patsStrong`: the cone every `TrEnv`-premised result in this file
--     already sits in. Upstream pins the same set itself in `Tests/ProjInhabit.lean`.
--     So the row moves from "priced, not paid" to "paid, on the general cone", and the
--     projection round stops being a SEPARATE upstream-gated item.
--
--     The cost is stated, not hidden: the proved statement is against `kenv`, so a
--     discharge route must supply the structure facts. That is `ProjStructFacts`
--     (`ProjDischarge.lean`), free wherever the projection column is empty
--     (`projStructFacts_of_noProjs`) and derivable from `ProjShape` (which gained
--     `ival.all = [S]`), but NOT free for the registration route, which used to contain no
--     kernel environment at all.

--
-- (c) THE FIXTURES WERE REBUILT, AND THEY ARE SORRY-FREE. `TrProjCtor` went from an
--     8-argument `def` over a CONSTANT motive and an explicit `mkApps` spine to an
--     11-argument `structure` with eight named fields over the thesis's DEPENDENT motive,
--     with `e' = .app (VExpr.projFn …) e`. Nothing could be patched. Both `MyProd` and
--     `MyOfNat` witnesses are re-derived on upstream's `Tests/ProjInhabit.lean` model and
--     measure `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` — no `sorryAx`, so the projection
--     layer is still demonstrably non-vacuous, now at the redesigned relation.

--
-- (d) THE ι INTERFACE IS CONSTRUCTOR-KEYED NOW. `VRecRule` gained a `ctorParams` field, so
--     `VEnv.addRecRule` keys the registered pattern on the CONSTRUCTOR's `numParams`, not
--     the recursor's, and `SimplePattern.iotaRHS` gained a `cnp` argument. `pats_iota'`
--     also RETURNS the constructor, tied to the kernel. All still `sorryAx`-free here.

--
--     ⚠️ A SURVEY CLAIM THAT IS WRONG, RECORDED SO IT IS NOT ACTED ON. The drift survey
--     said `pats_iota'` returning the constructor makes `ProjCtorAgree`/`ProjRecRules`
--     "pure epicycle — retire them". It does not. `pats_iota'` ties the pattern's
--     constructor to the KERNEL (`kenv.find? cName`); `ProjCtorAgree` ties it to
--     `Γ.ctors`, the ERASURE CONTEXT's registration. No upstream lemma spans that gap —
--     it is the same `VEnv`/`Γ` boundary slice P6 identified — so the bridge is still
--     ours. `projCtorAgree_of_trEnv` is re-proved on `pats_iota_inv_shape` (the successor
--     to the deleted `pats_iota_inv`) and stays `sorryAx`-free.

--
-- (e) `Ordered` → `OrderedStrong`, AND WHERE THE TRUST MOVED TO. `VExpr.WF.app_inv` (and
--     the whole substitution family and primitives layer) now demand `OrderedStrong`
--     (= `Ordered` + `OnTypes (EnvStrong env)` + `PatsStrongOn`), so this repo's
--     `VExpr.WF.mkApps_head` and `TrExprS.mkApps` do too. The effect on the ledger is
--     GOOD and worth stating precisely: those two lemmas are now `sorryAx`-FREE at the
--     hypothesis, and the obligation surfaces at whoever builds `OrderedStrong` from a
--     `VEnv.WF` (`VEnv.WF.orderedStrong`, which is exactly `patsStrong`). Trust that used
--     to be buried inside `IsDefEq.strong` under fifteen scattered markers is now
--     LOCATED at one named premise.

--
-- (f) AXIOMS. lean4lean's `axiom` count went 73 → 74. The delta is exactly one real
--     declaration, `any_eq_any_toList` (`Verify/Axioms.lean`), a `Std.TreeMap` bridging
--     axiom of the same class as the pre-existing `all_eq_all_toList`, arriving from the
--     upstream-`master` merge rather than from either commissioned cluster. Nothing in
--     this file's sets changed shape because of it.
--
-- (g) A SOUNDNESS-OF-FORMULATION NOTE, AND A SCOPE LIMIT.
--     `VInductDecl.WF` stopped being a `sorry` and became a real 14-field §2.6
--     direct-block specification (positivity, universes, large elimination, constructor
--     result types, `recs_over_block`, `rules_ctor`, …). Upstream's own review mechanized
--     two sorry-free counterexamples against EARLIER commits of this branch — a `WF` that
--     admitted inconsistent environments, and a `patsStrong` route that missed WF-admitted
--     off-block rules — and records both as FIXED at the surveyed head. The pin this file
--     used to measure against, `b6a5a38`, predates both the fix and the specification (WF
--     was still `sorry` there), so the exposure is different in kind, not worse.
--
--     ⚠️ WHAT MAY NOT BE WRITTEN: "the `TrEnv` horizon closes", unqualified. `TrProjCtor`
--     covers single-constructor types that are non-recursive, non-indexed and non-mutual;
--     `inferProj` (kernel and lean4lean) accepts reflexive, indexed and nested ones too,
--     and core's own `Lean.Language.SnapshotTree.element` is exactly such a raw `.proj`.
--     A `TrEnv` witness is constructible for prelude structures but NOT for an environment
--     containing `SnapshotTree`. That is a COMPLETENESS boundary, not a soundness one, and
--     it must accompany the claim.
--
-- (h) STILL OPEN, UNCHANGED BY THIS RE-PIN: `inferProj.WF` (now split, with a scoped
--     `inferProj.WF_struct` beside it, both `sorry`), `reduceProj`/`reduceProjCore.WF`
--     (not attempted — needs constructor-head injectivity), `tryEtaStructCore.WF`,
--     `isDefEqUnitLike.WF`, `addDecl.WF`'s `inductDecl` case, and `NormalEq.parRed`'s two
--     cases. `IsDefEq.church_rosser` is now sorry-FREE — its `pat` case was one of the
--     fifteen.
