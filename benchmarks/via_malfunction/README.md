## OPAM switches
The pipeline for the `malfunction-*` backends uses programs installed in a variety of OPAM switches,
whose names are configurable via Make variables.
- `LBOX_NO_UNBOX_SWITCH`: in which the `lbox` tool,
  modified to accept "raw lambdabox", is installed.
  The modified `lbox` source code is available at https://github.com/simon-dima/lambda-box-extraction/tree/release.
  This switch is used when the Make variable `UNBOX` is set to `0` (e.g. when using the backend `malfunction-prune-nounbox`).
- `LBOX_UNBOX_SWITCH`: in which the `lbox` tool,
  modified to accept "raw lambdabox" *and* perform unboxing in the extraction step to Malfunction,
  is installed.
  The modified `lbox` source code is available at https://github.com/simon-dima/lambda-box-extraction/tree/unbox.
  This switch is used when the Make variable `UNBOX` is set to `1`.
- `MALFUNCTION_NO_FLAMBDA_SWITCH`: in which the `malfunction` executable is installed.
  Used when the Make variable `FLAMBDA` is set to `0` (e.g. when using the backend `malfunction-noflambda`).
  This switch should have an OCaml toolchain without flambda.
- `MALFUNCTION_FLAMBDA_SWITCH`: in which the `malfunction` executable is installed.
  Used when the Make variable `FLAMBDA` is set to `1`.
  This switch should have an OCaml toolchain with flambda.

These four switches are not required to be distinct or have matching OCaml versions.

Each backend uses one switch for `lbox` and one for `malfunction` switch;
For example, `malfunction-reference` refers to `LBOX_UNBOX_SWITCH` and `MALFUNCTION_FLAMBDA_SWITCH`,
but does not require the switches `LBOX_NO_UNBOX_SWITCH` or `MALFUNCTION_NOFLAMBDA_SWITCH` to exist.

## Configuration options
These Make variables control the behavior of the pipeline.
- `UNBOX` (0 or 1 (default)): whether to perform unboxing of single-constructor single-argument inductive types.
- `PRUNE_CONSTRUCTORS` (0 or 1 (default)): whether to remove irrelevant arguments from constructors during erasure.
- `INLINE_AXIOMS` (0 or 1 (default)): whether to use versions of the OCaml axioms providing fast arithmetic with inlining annotations.
- `FLAMBDA` (0 or 1 (default)): whether to use an OCaml toolchain with Flambda optimizations.
- `ARRAYML` ("JCFArray.ml" (default), "SekArray.ml" or "UnsafeArray.ml"): which implementation of the array axioms to use.
  Using `SekArray.ml` requires the OCaml package `Sek` to be installed in the appropriate `MALFUNCTION` switch.
