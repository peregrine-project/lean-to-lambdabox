Lean Expr
- Prepare conversion:
  - replaceUnsafeRecNames
  - macroInline, inlineMatchers, macroInline
Lean Expr
- Convert to TypedML:
  - csimp replacements at the leaf level (doing this before might break typing)
  - read Lean inlining annotations
  - read Lean extern annotations
  - read Lean types and emit TypedML types
  - erase logical content and types from expressions
  Minimal structural modifications!
TypedML (early)
- Structural changes here:
  - fully apply constructors [x]
  - remove parameters from constructor applications (optionally)
  - fully apply casesOn and emit match
  - change Nat and Int literals, constructors, and match to use native integers
  - mutual recursion to fixpoints
TypedML (late)
- Convert to lambdabox
Lambdabox (typed)
- Serialize to s-expression


# MetaRocq questions
- what is the field "original arities" in ExAst.v one_inductive_body for? Is it arity before dearging but after parameter removal?
