# `LBClosed` + the de-Bruijn commutation kit for `LBTerm`

Target-side de-Bruijn metatheory, independent of the erasure relation: the
closedness predicate `LBClosed` (with its congruence/monotonicity/stability
lemmas) and the general `shift`/`subst` commutation laws.

**`LBClosed`.** `LBClosed t k` holds when `t` has no loose de-Bruijn index `≥ k`
(the `LBTerm` analogue of lean4lean's `Lean4Lean.Closed`). It is what makes
`LBTerm.shift`/`LBTerm.subst` the identity on a closed `.fix` node, whose bodies live
under `defs.length` binders and are otherwise closed. Defined by the same mutual
recursion as `LBTerm.shift`/`hasFVar` (the per-list traversals factored into helpers so
the structural-recursion checker sees through the nested `List` occurrences).

**Closedness under evaluation.** `WcbvEval.lbClosed`: a closed term's value is closed,
given an environment whose declared bodies are closed. It is the side condition the ι
step's β-chain rewrite asks for, and the only part of this module that reads `WcbvEval`.

**The commutation kit.** `LBTerm.shift_shift`, `LBTerm.subst_shift_cancel`,
`LBTerm.subst_shift_comm` and their capstone `LBTerm.subst_subst` (the standard
de-Bruijn distribution law `σ ∘ [t] = [σ t] ∘ σ⁺`).

Everything here is pure target-side reasoning — no lean4lean, hence `sorryAx`-free.

/-! ### …and the converse, at the unit shift

`LBTerm.shift 1 k` is the identity on `t` *only* when there is nothing at or above `k` to
move. Read backwards, that turns a shift-inertness equation about a term into a closedness
fact about it. It is the closedness twin of `not_hasFVar_of_toBvar_eq_self`, which reads a
`toBvar` fixed point the same way. -/

point, for the three list traversals `shift` descends through. -/

/-! ## Part 3 — the general de-Bruijn commutation kit

`shift`/`subst` interaction laws for arbitrary `LBTerm`s, culminating in
`LBTerm.subst_subst` (the standard distribution law). `Optimize.lean` proves
`.box`-specialised siblings of `subst_shift_cancel`/`subst_subst`; those live in a
different branch of the import DAG, so the general forms are re-derived here.

All the inductions are over `LBTerm.recData`, generalizing every cutoff. Arithmetic
side conditions are carried as *equations* (`hm : m = d + c`) rather than being baked
into the statement: crossing a binder turns `m + 1 = (d + 1) + c` into an `omega` step
instead of a rewrite, which is what keeps the `hcase`/`hfix` arms (where the cutoffs
move by a variable `ns.length`/`defs.length`) mechanical. -/

/-! ## Part 4 — `substList` over a reversed list, and the closedness proviso

`substList ss t` sequences `subst1`s left to right (`Semantics/Substitution.lean`), so a
list appended on the right substitutes **last**. The one law the ι reversal bridge needs
is `substList_reverse_subst`: a substitution sitting *under* `rest.length` binders can be
pulled out through `substList rest.reverse`, at the price of requiring the terms in
`rest` to be de-Bruijn closed.

The proviso is not slack. Unfolded at `rest = [g]`, the law says
`subst1 g (subst f 1 u) = subst f 0 (subst1 g u)`, and `subst_subst` turns the right-hand
side into `subst (subst f 0 g) 0 (subst f 1 u)`: the two agree exactly when
`subst f 0 g = g`, i.e. when the *later* field `g` has no loose `bvar 0`. With, say,
`u = .bvar 0` and `g = .lambda n (.bvar 1)` they genuinely differ — the counterexample
recorded at `wcbvEval_mkApps_mkLambdas_substList` (`IotaBridge.lean`), and the reason
MetaRocq's `eval` carries `closedn 0` side conditions throughout. -/

`Erasure.mkAlt` and `Erasure.mkDef` close a body over free variables by folding `toBvar`
at successive levels, and `closeFix` is the `mkDef` fold in de-Bruijn form
(`closeFixFold_eq_foldl`). `lbClosed_foldl_zipIdx` is that fold's closedness arithmetic:
it takes a bound on one opened body to a bound on the closed `.fix` node. -/

/-! ### A `.fix` node's own closedness

`LBClosed (.fix defs j) 0` is `LBClosedDefs defs defs.length`: each definition's body is
closed *below the block's own binders*, one per definition. It is therefore **not** a
property of an arbitrary `defs` — `[{ body := .bvar 5 }]` is a counterexample — but of a
block whose bodies were closed over exactly the block's names, which is what
`Erasure.mkDef` does. -/

/-- A block of bodies closed at the block's own size is a closed `.fix` node, at every
index (including out-of-range ones, which `LBClosed` does not constrain). -/
theorem lbClosed_fix_of_bodies {defs : List (@FixDef LBTerm)} {k : Nat}

/-! ## Part 6 — closedness under evaluation

`WcbvEval` substitutes: β and ζ substitute one value, ι a list of constructor fields, and
`fix` the block's own unfolding. Each of those is a `LBClosed` law of Part 2, so the only
thing the induction needs from outside the term is `hΓ`: the bodies `delta` unfolds are
closed, since nothing in the subject `.const kn` bounds them. -/

/-- **Evaluation preserves closedness.** `hΓ` is the environment clause the pass layer
carries (every declared body is closed); without it the `delta` case is false, since a
`.const kn` subject is closed at every `k` while its body need not be. -/
