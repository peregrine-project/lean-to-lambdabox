# `closeFix`: the `n`-way fvar → de-Bruijn abstraction of a mutual `fix` block (P3 foundation)

Pure-`LBTerm` foundation for the environment-level erasure of *recursive* Lean
definitions (workstream P3, `notes/P3_ENV_ERASURE_DESIGN.md` §1.5/§2). This file is
**additive and self-contained** — it adds no constructor to `Erases`, touches no
forward-simulation lemma, and imports only `Abstract` (the single-fvar `toBvar`
metatheory). It models the closing step of the shipping `mkDef`.

## What the shipping code does

For a recursive mutual block `names = [n₀ … n₍ₘ₋₁₎]`, the eraser (`Erasure.visitMutual`,
Erasure.lean:904) picks `m` fresh fvars `ids = [x₀ … x₍ₘ₋₁₎]`, erases each def body
with the sibling references `.const nₖ` mapped to `.fvar xₖ` (via `visitConst`,
Erasure.lean:662), and then closes every body with `mkDef` (Erasure.lean:273):

```lean
def mkDef (name : Name) (fixvarnames : List Name) (body : LBTerm) : EraseM (@FixDef LBTerm) := do
  let mut body := body
  for (n, i) in fixvarnames.reverse.zipIdx do
    body := toBvar ((← read).fixvars.get![n]!) i body
  return { name := .named name.toString, body }
```

So `mkDef` folds `toBvar` over `fixvarnames.reverse.zipIdx`, looking up each name's
fvar. Because the block names zip with `ids` in order, this is exactly
`closeFix ids body` below: it sends the **last** sibling `x₍ₘ₋₁₎ ↦ .bvar 0` and the
**first** sibling `x₀ ↦ .bvar (m-1)`, matching the de-Bruijn convention of the
`.fix` node (`LBTerm.fix`, Basic.lean:104), whose bodies live under `m` binders and
refer to sibling `k` by `.bvar (m-1-k)` (cf. `fixSubst`, Substitution.lean:220, which
re-instantiates `.bvar (m-1-k) ↦ .fix defs (m-1-k)`).

The lemmas here establish the two facts the reconciliation needs:

* **`closeFix` = the `mkDef` fold** (definitional), so the shipping output is exactly
  `closeFix`.
* **`closeFix_fvar`**: for distinct `ids`, `closeFix ids 0 (.fvar xₖ) = .bvar (m-1-k)` —
  the per-sibling abstraction result. This is the pure-`LBTerm` skeleton of the
  `Erases.abstractFixvars` lemma of the design (§1.5); the `Erases`-level version
  lifts it once the `Erases.fix` rule lands (deferred, XL — see the design doc).

/-! ### `closeFix` = the shipping `mkDef` fold

`mkDef`'s loop is `List.forIn … (fun (n,i) body => toBvar (fixvars[n]) i body)` over
`fixvarnames.reverse.zipIdx`. Modulo the `fixvars` lookup (`fixvars[nₖ] = xₖ` by
construction), that is `closeFixFold (ids.reverse.zipIdx)` — i.e. `closeFix ids 0`. We
record the fold-shape correspondence at the pure `(fvar, level)`-list level; the
`fixvars`-lookup layer is discharged in the (deferred) `visitMutual` reconciliation. -/

/-- A left fold of `toBvar` over an explicit pair list equals `closeFixFold`.  This is
the bridge from `mkDef`'s imperative `for` (which elaborates to `List.foldl` over
`reverse.zipIdx`) to the structural `closeFixFold`. -/

/-! ### `closeFix` is the identity on terms free of the block fvars

If none of the block fvars occur in `t`, closing is a no-op (each `toBvar` step is,
by `toBvar_eq_of_not_hasFVar`). Used to show that a def body already closed below the
fix binders is untouched, and for the base cases of the per-sibling characterisation. -/

/-! ### `closeFix` removes the block fvars and introduces none

The dual of the previous section, and the reason a `.fix` node the pass builds is closed at
**every** free variable: a closing step can only delete occurrences, and it deletes exactly
those of the variable it abstracts. The reflection form comes first — it is what keeps the
consumers free of a membership decision on `FVarId`. -/

/-! ### Distinct-fvar bookkeeping for the per-sibling result

`toBvar y lvl` leaves `.fvar x` (`x ≠ y`) unchanged, and leaves any `.bvar` unchanged;
so once a fvar has been sent to its `.bvar`, the remaining closing steps do not touch
it, and steps for *other* fvars do not touch it beforehand. -/

instantiates at the position of each block fvar in the `reverse.zipIdx` (`closeFix`). -/

/-! ### Non-vacuity: a concrete 2-def block closes to the `mkDef` convention

`ids = [x₀, x₁]` (block of 2), base 0. `closeFix` folds `[(x₁,0),(x₀,1)]`:
* the last sibling `x₁ ↦ .bvar 0`,
* the first sibling `x₀ ↦ .bvar 1`.
So a body `x₀ x₁` (def 0 calling itself then its sibling) closes to `.bvar 1 .bvar 0`
— exactly what the `.fix` node expects (sibling `k ↦ .bvar (m-1-k)`, here m = 2). -/
