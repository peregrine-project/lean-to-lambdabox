# Discharging `IotaConsistent` — the chain, end to end

`IotaPattern.lean` supplies the pattern-side core: a `Pattern.Matches` introduction
rule for spines, the `SimplePattern.iotaRHS` reduct calculation, `TrExprS` spine
inversion *and construction*, the named upstream spec `PatsIotaSpec`, and
`iota_defeq_spine`, which **fires** the ι rule on a translated exact-arity redex.

This file closes the chain: the source-level β engine, the per-`casesOn` shape
certificate `IotaShape`, the derivation `iotaConsistent_of_shape`, and the constructed
non-vacuity guards.

## The chain

For a `casesOn` spine `con pre… discr minors…` whose scrutinee has evaluated to a
saturated constructor spine, `IotaConsistent` asks for a definitional equality to
`(cargs.drop np).foldl Expr.app minors[cidx]`:

```
 (0)  ve   = ⟦con pre… (ctor C̄) minors…⟧                  -- the source spine
 (1)  ≡ δ    unfold `con` to its value                     -- SEnvConsistent
 (2)  ≡ β    reduce the casesOn wrapper to the rec spine   -- trExprS_betaN + IotaShape
 (3)  ≡ ι    the registered rule fires                     -- iota_defeq_spine
 (4)  ≡ β    reduce the rule template through its telescope
 (5)  ≡ β    unwrap the casesOn-inserted minor wrapper     -- trExprS_betaN + IotaShape
           = ⟦minors[cidx] (C̄.drop np)⟧
```

**δ via `SEnvConsistent`, not `TrEnv.of_value`.** The repo already threads the source
δ facts as `SEnvConsistent` (a premise of `SEvalβζδ_defeq` and `SEvalDataι_defeq`), so
step (1) reuses it. That is not just economical: `TrEnv.of_value` routes through
`H.map_wf`, and `TrEnv'.map_wf := H.aligned.map_wf` whose `induct` case is
`Aligned.addInduct`, an IOTA-TODO `sorry` at the current pin — so the `of_value` route
*would* inherit a gap that `pats_iota` (deliberately routed through the
`Aligned`-free `TrEnv'.constMap_wf`) does not. This contradicts the handoff note's
"you inherit no new gap", which is accurate for `pats_iota` alone. A de-tainting of
`of_value` (swapping `map_wf → constMap_wf`) was proposed on the fork and **rejected in
review**, so `of_value` stays `Aligned`-routed at the `1a1ebe8` pin; we neither rely on
it nor work around it.

## `TrExprS` for the ι *reduct* spine

`IotaConsistent`'s conclusion demands a **`TrExprS` of an application spine** that is
*not* a subterm of the redex and is well-typed only because the ι rule fired, so no app
node of the input supplies the two `HasType` fields of `TrExprS.app`.

They are supplied by **application generation**: `Lean4Lean.VEnv.HasType.app_inv`
(`Theory/Typing/Strong.lean`) is a *proved theorem* at the current pin —
`Strong.lean`'s `IsDefEq.strong` / `IsDefEqStrong.hasType'` layering exists precisely
to prove it — with premises `env.Ordered` and `OnCtx Γ (env.IsType U)`, both already in
scope everywhere here. (`Experimental/NormalEq.lean` also *states* an `app_inv`, but as
a field of an abstract `Typing` class — an interface, not evidence of unavailability.)
`TrExprS.mkApps` (`IotaPattern.lean`) packages it. Its sorry-frontier is a subset of
the one `VEnv.IsDefEq.uniqU` already carries, and `uniqU` is used pervasively in the
committed development, so this adds no sorry-carrying declaration.

## What is assumed

* **`PatsIotaSpec`** — the named interface structure: the fork's strengthened rule
  lookup, discharged for any translated environment by `PatsIotaSpec.of_trEnv`.
* **`SEnvConsistent`** — already an accepted premise of the surrounding development.
* **`IotaShape`** — the per-`casesOn` certificate: kernel lookups plus `Expr`
  equations, `rfl`/`decide`-checkable for any concrete inductive. Nothing in it is a
  typing or translation assumption.

No new `sorry` and no new axiom.

## Non-vacuity guards

`iotaConsistent_of_shape` takes `env.WF`, and `VEnv.WF` is **unconstructible for a
`pats`-carrying environment at this pin** (`VEnv.Ordered` has no `addPat` clause;
`addInduct_WF` and `addDecl.WF`'s `inductDecl` case are `sorry`). So — exactly as for
`SEvalDataι_defeq` — a guard that instantiates the whole theorem is not available, and
the guards stay at the level of its two halves:

* `envι_iota_fires` — the ι machinery fires and yields a real `IsDefEqU`, on a `VEnv`
  built by `VEnv.addPat` directly. `sorryAx`-free. Its shape exercises the `take`/`drop`
  conventions of `SimplePattern.iotaRHS_apply` at `np = nmot = nmin = nind = nfields = 1`,
  so **both** `np > 0` and `nind > 0`: with `np = nind = 0` (`Bool`, enums) both slices
  degenerate and a reversed convention would still look right, whereas here the six
  arguments are pairwise distinct (`bvar 0 … bvar 5`) and the reduct visibly drops
  `bvar 3` — the recursor's **index**, which sits between the minors and the major —
  and `bvar 4` — the constructor's **parameter** — keeping `[bvar 0, bvar 1, bvar 2]`
  and `[bvar 5]`.
* `betaN_casesOn_guard` / `betaN_ruleTemplate_guard` — `IotaShape`'s `Expr` equations
  hold, by `rfl`, on a concrete `casesOn` wrapper and a concrete recursor rule template
  at the same `np = nmot = nmin = nind = nfields = 1` shape. The first certifies the
  argument **reordering** between `C.casesOn`'s telescope
  (`params motive indices major minors`) and `C.rec`'s
  (`params motives minors indices major`); the second certifies that `betaN` stops with
  the branch **applied to** the fields rather than contracting them away.
* `betaN_ruleTemplate_eta_guard` / `betaN_ruleTemplate_rec_guard` — the *two-stage* form
  against the shapes the kernel really generates: `Option.casesOn`'s η-wrapper
  (`ihs = []`) and `Nat.casesOn`'s IH-discarding wrapper (`ihs ≠ []`). The degenerate
  guard above uses a hand-written non-η template, which is why the single-stage
  statement's unsatisfiability for every field-carrying inductive went unnoticed.

/-! ## Steps (2)/(4)/(5): the β-normalisation engine

Steps (2), (4) and (5) of the chain are all the same operation — apply a source
λ-telescope to a list of arguments and β-reduce — so they share one engine.

The key point is that a β step produces the reduct's `TrExprS` **for free**, via
`TrExprS.inst`: no application node has to be built. (The one place an application
node *is* built — re-attaching the model's ι reduct to the source rule template — goes
through `TrExprS.mkApps`, i.e. through application generation.) -/

/-- One head β step on a source `Expr`: contract if the head is a λ, otherwise just
apply. Splitting this out of `betaN` keeps `betaN e (a :: as) = betaN (betaHead e a) as`
an unconditional `rfl`. -/
def betaHead : Expr → Expr → Expr
  | .lam _ _ b _, a => b.instantiate1' a 0
  | e, a => .app e a

/-- Iterated head β: apply `f` to `args`, contracting each redex as it appears. This
is the *source-level* normal form the shape certificate's `casesOn`-value and
rule-template equations are stated against. -/

/-- **One β step, as a definitional equality.** A translated redex
`(fun x => b) a` is defeq to the translation of `b[a]` — and the reduct's `TrExprS`
comes from `TrExprS.inst`, so no application node has to be constructed. This is the
`SEvalβζδ_defeq` `beta` case with the "evaluate `f` and `a` first" detour removed. -/

/-! ## The per-`casesOn` shape certificate

Everything the ι chain needs about the *kernel* that `TrEnv`/`VInductDecl.WF` do not
pin — `VInductDecl.WF`'s own docstring says it does not "pin the recursor/rule shape to
the one `addInduct` reduces with" — is packaged here, per registered `casesOn`, as
kernel lookups plus **`Expr` equations**. For any concrete inductive every equation is
a closed `Expr` equality between a `betaN` computation and a spine, hence `rfl`- or
`decide`-checkable; nothing in it is a typing or translation assumption.

The two β equations are exactly steps (2) and (4)/(5) of the chain:

* `hunfold` — the `casesOn`'s δ-value, applied to `params ++ motive ++ indices`, the
  major premise and the minors, β-normalises to the **recursor redex**
  `(rec P̄ M̄ minors Ī) major`. This is where the argument reordering between
  `C.casesOn`'s telescope (`params motive indices major minors`) and `C.rec`'s
  (`params motives minors indices major`) is recorded, by the `recArgs` function.
* the per-constructor equation, **in two β stages** — the recursor rule's template,
  applied to the recursor spine's `params ++ motives ++ minors` (the ι reduct's rec-side
  slice) and then the constructor's fields (its ctor-side slice), β-normalises to a
  *wrapper* applied to the fields **and the recursive calls**; the wrapper then discards
  the recursive calls and hands the fields to the selected minor. `betaN` stops when its
  pending argument list is exhausted, so the applications the template's body builds
  survive even when the minor is itself a λ — which is what makes this equal to
  `IotaConsistent`'s target rather than to its β-contraction.

  **Why two stages** (probed against the real kernel, v4.33.0-rc2). Lean's generated
  `casesOn` **η-expands every minor that takes fields**, and for a recursive inductive
  the wrapper additionally swallows the induction hypotheses:
  ```
  Bool.casesOn   := fun {motive} t false true => Bool.rec false true t
  Option.casesOn := fun {α} {motive} t none some => Option.rec none (fun val => some val) t
  Nat.casesOn    := fun {motive} t zero succ => Nat.rec zero (fun n n_ih => succ n) t
  Nat.rec's succ rule rhs = fun motive zero succ n => succ n (Nat.rec zero succ n)
  ```
  So for anything but a zero-field constructor the single-stage reduct ends in a redex
  `betaN` cannot contract — it is created *inside* the template's body, not pending in
  the supplied argument list — and the old one-stage equation was **unsatisfiable for
  `Option`, `Nat`, `List`, `Prod`, …**, i.e. for every inductive except enumerations.
  (The earlier guard did not catch this because it used a hand-written, *non*-η-expanded
  template, a shape no real `casesOn` has.)

  Stage two *discards* `ihs`, which is exactly the semantic content of "a `casesOn` is a
  recursor whose minors ignore the recursive results" — the fact that makes
  `SEvalDataι.iota`'s reduct `(cargs.drop np).foldl app minors[cidx]` (fields only, no
  IHs) the right source-side reduct in the first place. Making it a certificate
  *obligation* rather than an unstated assumption is a strict improvement in honesty.
  For a non-recursive inductive with a zero-field constructor the wrapper is the minor
  itself, `ihs = []`, and stage two is `rfl`. -/

/-! ### The guard environment

Three constants over a single base type `I : Sort 1`: a "recursor" `R` of arity
`4 + 1` (params + motives + minors + indices, then the major premise) and a
"constructor" `K` of arity `2` (one parameter, one field). No `VEnv.WF` is needed or
claimed — `VEnv.IsDefEq.pat` does not require it, and `VEnv.addPat` is outside the
`Ordered` decl chain anyway (`addInduct_WF` is `sorry` upstream). -/

`IsDefEqU`, so the `PatsIotaSpec`/`iota_defeq_spine` bundle is not vacuous.

**It also pins the `take`/`drop` conventions.** The recursor spine is
`[b₀, b₁, b₂, b₃]` and the constructor spine `[b₄, b₅]`, with `np = nind = 1`; the
reduct is the template applied to `[b₀, b₁, b₂, b₅]`. So `b₃` (the recursor's
**index**) and `b₄` (the constructor's **parameter**) are dropped, and the order is
forward — no reversal (MetaRocq's `iota_red` reverses; the model's `RHS.apply` does
not, and that asymmetry lives on the target side, not here). -/

/-! ### Guards for `IotaShape`'s two `Expr` equations

Both are checked at the same `np = nmot = nmin = nind = nfields = 1` shape as
`envι_iota_fires`, on five/four pairwise distinct arguments, so the reordering and the
slicing are visible rather than degenerate. -/

private def ty : Expr := .const `I []

/-- The `casesOn` wrapper at `np = nmot = nidx = nmin = 1`:

/-- **`IotaShape.hunfold` fires.** The `casesOn` wrapper, applied to
`pre = [p, motive, idx]`, the major premise and `minors = [minor]`, β-normalises to the
recursor redex — with the arguments **reordered** from `C.casesOn`'s telescope
(`params motive indices major minors`) to `C.rec`'s
(`params motives minors indices major`): `recArgs [p,m,i] [mn] = [p, m, mn, i]`, and
the major premise moves to the outside. -/

template, applied to the recursor spine's `take (np+nmot+nmin) = [p, motive, minor]`
(the **index** `A2` is dropped) and then the constructor's fields `[f0]` (its
**parameter** having been dropped by the ctor-side `drop np`), β-normalises to the
selected minor **applied to** the fields — not to their contraction: `betaN` stops when
its pending argument list is exhausted, so the application the template's body builds
survives. Here the `casesOn` inserted no wrapper, so `wrapper = minor`, `ihs = []` and
stage two is `rfl`. -/

/-! ### Guards for the *two-stage* form (ι Task 3)

The degenerate guard above uses a hand-written, non-η-expanded template — a shape no
real `casesOn` has, which is exactly why the single-stage statement survived as long as
it did. These two check the stage split against the shapes the kernel actually generates:
`Option.casesOn`'s η-wrapper (`fun val => some val`, `ihs = []`) and `Nat.casesOn`'s
IH-discarding wrapper (`fun n n_ih => succ n`, `ihs ≠ []`). Both stages are closed `Expr`
computations, hence `rfl`. -/

`fun val => minor val`. -/
private def someW : Expr := .lam `v ty (.app A4 (.bvar 0)) .default

/-- **Stage split at `Option.some`'s shape** (`np = nmot = 1`, `nmin = 2`, one field).
The template reduces to the *η-wrapper* applied to the field — a redex the single-stage
equation could not express — and the wrapper then hands the field to the minor. -/

/-- **Stage split at `Nat.succ`'s shape** (`np = 0`, `nmot = 1`, `nmin = 2`, one field,
**recursive**). Stage one produces the wrapper applied to the field *and the recursive
call*; stage two **discards** the recursive call — which is precisely the fact that makes
`SEvalDataι.iota`'s fields-only reduct the right one. -/
