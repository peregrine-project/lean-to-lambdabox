# Discharging `ProjConsistent` — the chain, and the one link `ProjShape` does not supply

`ProjPattern.lean` supplies the interface half: `TrProjCtor` (the `TrProj` witness with
its constructor named), `ProjDefeqSpec` (upstream's `TrEnv.proj_defeq` in the
strengthened form it has to be stated in), `ProjShape` (the `rfl`-checkable per-structure
kernel certificate) and `TrExprS.proj_inv'`. This file composes them into
`projConsistent_of_shape`, the `iotaConsistent_of_shape` analogue.

## The chain, and why it is short

```
 (0)  ve = ⟦.proj S i discr⟧                    -- TrExprS.proj_inv'
 (1)  ⇒ TrExprS Δ discr dve  ∧  TrProjCtor env … S i dve ve c
 (2)  hdiscr dve             ⇒ TrExprS Δ (ctor c̄) cve ∧ IsDefEqU dve cve
 (3)  cve = mkApps (const ctor us') cargs'      -- TrExprS.mkApps_inv + const_inv
 (4)  c = ctor                                  -- ProjCtorAgree (see below)
 (5)  ≡ proj  ProjDefeqSpec.proj_defeq at params := cargs'.take np,
                                          fields := cargs'.drop np
 (6)  TrExprS Δ cargs[np+i] cargs'[np+i]        -- straight off the Forall₂ of (3)
```

Step (6) is *free*, and it was the expensive step in ι: the ι reduct is a spine that is
**not** a subterm of the redex, so its `TrExprS` had to be built by application
generation (`TrExprS.mkApps` / `VEnv.HasType.app_inv`, `IotaDischarge.lean`). A
projection's reduct **is** a subterm of the redex, so it is read straight off
`TrExprS.mkApps_inv`'s `List.Forall₂`. No `HasType.app_inv`, no `TrExprS.mkApps`, no
`betaN`, no two-stage η problem, and no new sorry-frontier: this file's declarations
measure the three standard axioms and nothing else.

## ⚠️ `ProjShape` does not discharge the constructor agreement — a design claim that failed

The design (`§3.1` item 3, `§3.2` step (3)) states that `ProjShape`'s `ival.ctors =
[ctor]` conjunct supplies `ProjDefeqSpec`'s missing agreement: *"the structure has
exactly one constructor, so the `TrProj` witness's `ctorName` and the spine's head are
the same name."* **It does not, and cannot.**

`ProjShape` relates `kenv` to `Γ`. The `TrProjCtor` witness's `ctorName` comes from
neither: it is bound by the `env.pats` membership, i.e. it is a fact about the **`VEnv`**.
`ProjShape` never mentions `env`, so no instance of it can constrain that name. The
informal argument silently uses a `kenv`↔`env` alignment — which is exactly what a
`TrEnv` is, and exactly what `ProjDefeqSpec`'s eventual `of_trEnv` discharge will have in
hand.

So the agreement is named here, as `ProjCtorAgree`, in the same idiom and for the same
reason `ProjDefeqSpec` itself is named: it is the *interface*, `TrEnv` is the (future)
implementation, and naming it keeps the obligation one declaration instead of an
assumption smuggled through a certificate that provably cannot carry it. Like
`ProjDefeqSpec` it is a `Prop` hypothesis, **never an axiom** — the round's two
upstream-gated items are both premises — and it is **not** a new trust item of a new
kind: it is the `VEnv`-side half of the same `TrEnv.proj_defeq` statement correction this
round already escalates upstream.

## ✅ …and the implementation arrived (re-pin `b6a5a38`)

The prediction above — *"`TrEnv` is what the eventual discharge will have in hand"* — is
now a theorem. `projCtorAgree_of_trEnv` derives `ProjCtorAgree` from a `TrEnv` plus
`ProjRecRules`, on upstream's new `TrEnv.pats_iota_inv` (the converse of `pats_iota'`,
delivered **fully proved and `sorryAx`-free**). The derivation is `sorryAx`-free too.

The one thing upstream did *not* deliver is the specialization that would have made the
discharge premise-free: `pats_iota_ctor`, folding in the recursor-rules ↔ `ival.ctors`
correspondence, is blocked because `VInductDecl.WF` does not pin the recursor/rule shape
at the inductive-translation boundary. So the fact moves rather than vanishes — but it
moves *from* the `VEnv`, where no downstream certificate can reach it, *to* `kenv`, where
`ProjShape` already states facts of exactly that class. That is the whole content of the
trade, and it is the one the round-2 ask sanctioned in advance.

`ProjDefeqSpec` is therefore the projection round's **single** remaining upstream-gated
premise. Its statement was corrected at the same re-pin (upstream adopted `TrProjCtor`
verbatim); only its proof is outstanding.

`ProjShape` still earns its place — `projConsistent_of_shape` takes it, and its
`ctorAgreement` accessor is what pins `Γ.ctorArities cn = some (np + nf)` — but it
reaches a caller's constructor only through a `Γ`-side uniqueness side condition (`hone`
below), while `ProjFieldsCoherent` (slice P0, discharged at registration by
`projFieldsCoherent_of_registered`) delivers the same fact with no kernel environment and
no side condition. `projConsistent_of_coh` is therefore the form a registered `Γ` should
use, and `projConsistent_of_shape` the form to quote against a `kenv`.

/-- **The pattern/registration constructor agreement.** The constructor named by the ι
rule that `env.pats` registers for structure `S`'s recursor is the constructor `Γ`
registers at index `0` for `S`'s inductive.

This is the hypothesis `TrEnv.proj_defeq` is missing (`ProjPattern.lean`'s section
docstring), pushed one layer down to where the discharge actually needs it, and it is
**not** derivable from `ProjShape`: `ProjShape` relates `kenv` to `Γ` and says nothing
about `env.pats`. See this module's docstring.

It is true for any `env` that a `TrEnv` translated from a `kenv` in which `S` is a
structure — one constructor, so there is only one name the rule could carry — and it is
refuted outright at a `pats`-free `env` (`projCtorAgree_of_noPats`), which is the
negative polarity. -/

/-- **Negative polarity.** At a `pats`-free environment `TrProjCtor` is uninhabited
(`trProjCtor_refuted`), so the agreement holds by refutation — which is exactly what
makes it a *hypothesis about the environment* rather than a fact about `Γ`. -/

/-! ### The positive discharge (re-pin `b6a5a38`)

The module docstring's finding stands — `ProjShape` cannot reach the `env.pats`-side
name — but the *route* it named as future work is now open. `TrEnv.pats_iota_inv`, the
converse of `pats_iota'`, is the `kenv`↔`env` alignment the informal argument was
silently using: from a registered ι pattern it recovers the kernel recursor `rval` under
`recName` and the rule keyed by the pattern's constructor. That turns the agreement from a
fact about an opaque `VEnv` into a fact about `kenv`'s recursor rules — which is the class
of fact `ProjShape` already carries, and which a certificate *can* state. -/

/-- **The kernel-side half of the agreement.** For every structure `S` that `Γ` registers,
`S`'s recursor is resolvable in `kenv` and every one of its ι rules is keyed by the
constructor `Γ` registers at index `0`.

This is a `kenv` fact of exactly the class `ProjShape`'s `find?` conjuncts are, and it is
the *one* ingredient upstream did not deliver: the round-2 ask proposed a specialization
`TrEnv.pats_iota_ctor` folding in the recursor-rules ↔ `ival.ctors` correspondence, and it
came back **not landed**, because lean4lean's `VInductDecl.WF` does not pin the
recursor/rule shape at the inductive-translation boundary. The ask sanctioned this
fallback explicitly ("2a alone is acceptable: downstream can bridge with a kernel-side
rules↔ctors fact, at the cost of an extra premise"), and this is that premise.

For a real Lean structure it is a kernel well-formedness triviality — `S.rec` has one rule
per constructor and a structure has one constructor — but a `Kernel.Environment` is opaque
in-logic, so it is stated rather than computed, exactly like `ProjShape.shape`. -/
def ProjRecRules (kenv : Lean.Kernel.Environment) (Γ : ErasureCtx) : Prop :=
  ∀ {S ctor : Name} {iid : InductiveId} {np : Nat},
    Γ.projs S = some (iid, np) → Γ.ctors ctor = some (iid, 0) →
    ∃ rval : Lean.RecursorVal,
      kenv.find? (mkRecName S) = some (.recInfo rval) ∧
      ∀ rule ∈ rval.rules, rule.ctor = ctor

/-- **The kernel's structure facts for the structures `Γ` registers.** Upstream's
`TrEnv.proj_defeq` was *proved* at `6fd8a1d` by deriving the recursor's
`(1 motive, 1 minor, 0 indices)` telescope split from the kernel's own structure facts —
non-mutual, single-constructor, non-indexed — rather than trying to recover it from the ι
pattern's sum, which the previous round had reported as the blocker. Those facts are
therefore premises of the reduction now, and a discharge route has to supply them.

This is the same class of certificate as `ProjRecRules` and `ProjShape`'s `find?`
conjuncts: a `Kernel.Environment` is opaque in-logic, so the facts are stated rather than
computed, and they are `rfl`-checkable at any concrete kernel environment. For a real Lean
structure every conjunct is a kernel well-formedness triviality.

⚠️ **This is what the proved `proj_defeq` costs the registration route.**
`projConsistent_of_coh` used to have no kernel environment in it at all — that was the
point of the registration route. It now needs this premise, because the reduction it fires
is stated against `kenv`. The alternative would be to keep assuming the *old*
`ProjDefeqSpec`, which upstream no longer proves, so this is the honest trade: a
kernel-side certificate in exchange for an assumption becoming a theorem. Whether the
registration route should instead carry a `TrEnv` (from which these facts are derivable
together with `ProjRecRules`) is a design question this migration deliberately leaves
open. -/

used to be is discharged here, from a `TrEnv` — the `kenv`↔`env` alignment the module
docstring identified as the missing ingredient — plus the kernel certificate above.

The proof is the four-step bridge: destructure `TrProjCtor` for its `env.pats` membership
and `recName = mkRecName S`; invert it with `TrEnv.pats_iota_inv` to a kernel recursor and
the rule keyed by the witness's constructor `c`; match that recursor against the
certificate's; and read `c = ctor` off `List.find?`. Nothing here is deferred: it is
`sorryAx`-free, and so is `pats_iota_inv` itself.

What this does **not** discharge is `ProjDefeqSpec` — that is the other half of the same
statement correction, and its proof is still `sorry` upstream. So a `TrEnv`-holding caller
now supplies one of `projConsistent_of_coh`'s two upstream-gated premises for real, and
takes the other on trust. -/

exactly one constructor for this inductive" says in the data `Γ` carries, and it is
`rfl`-checkable at any concrete `Γ` (`Γproj_ctorsUnique`).

That side condition is the module docstring's finding in operational form: a certificate
about `kenv` reaches a caller's `Γ`-side constructor only through a `Γ`-side uniqueness
fact, and it reaches the `env`-side pattern constructor not at all — hence
`ProjCtorAgree`. -/

/-! ### Guards

`ProjDefeqSpec` cannot be constructed *soundly* — its one implementation is upstream's
still-deferred lemma, and `ProjDefeqSpec.of_trEnv` (`ProjPattern.lean`) exists only to
price that deferral — so the guards are at the halves, exactly as the ι round's are
(`IotaDischarge.lean` records the same boundary for `iotaConsistent_of_shape`). What is
shown here is that the *composition* is not vacuous in the trivial way: the agreement
premise is inhabited at both polarities, and the `Γ`-side inputs of the discharge fire at
the round's fixture.

Since the re-pin the agreement is no longer only inhabited — it is **derived**
(`projCtorAgree_of_trEnv`), so the guard that matters for it is that its new kernel
premise costs nothing where the round's old `hnoprojs` guard sat. -/

/-- **`ProjRecRules` is free at a `Γ` that registers no structure.** The premise
`projCtorAgree_of_trEnv` trades `ProjCtorAgree` for is vacuous exactly where the whole
projection column is, so threading it through the pre-projection cone costs nothing — the
same property `ProjBridgeHyps.of_bot` has, and the reason the trade is a trade rather than
a new assumption. -/
