# The cold-start capstone: the subject becomes `Erasure.erase` (slice S4)

Every capstone so far has taken its subject to be a `visitExpr` run **under an abstract,
already-registered `ErasureState`**, with the environment `E`, the registration records
and the bridge invariant all supplied from outside. This file moves the subject to the
real `#erase` entry point,

```lean
Erasure.erase e cfg cctx ref w = .ok (p, inls) w'
```

from the **empty** state, and produces `E` and `t` rather than consuming them.

## What the walk discharges

Everything below is *derived from the run*, not assumed:

| premise of `…ι_registered` | how it dies |
|---|---|
| the abstract state `s` and the run `visitExpr e s …` | `ColdStartRun.erase_run_ok` (R1) |
| `sp`, the post-`prepare_erasure` state | `ColdStartRun.run_prepare_erasure_state` (R2), csimp off: it *is* `{}` |
| `hinv : BridgeInv …` | constructed at `{}` by `gBridgeInv_nil` |
| `E` as a free variable | becomes `sf.gdecls`, existentially produced |
| `hclenv : ClosedEnv E` | `RegInvShape.closed`, at the run's final state (S1e: carried by `visitExpr_regInvShape`, a theorem) |
| `hcl : LBClosed t 0` | `visitExpr_noFix_closed` (R11, no hypotheses) |
| `NoBlock t` (applied form of the output) | `visitExpr_noBlock` (R11's third conjunct, no hypotheses — slice δ-N) |
| `NoBlockEnv sf.gdecls` (applied form of every recorded body) | `visitExpr_noBlockEnv` (δ-N: `NoBlockEnv` is a `RunClosed` predicate) |
| `hregctors`/`hregcases`/`hregfields` | `RegInvShape.registeredCtors/…`, modulo saturation |
| `hprojenv : ErasesEnvProjs` and `hpcoh : ProjFieldsCoherent` (ι) | `RegInvShape.registeredProjs`/`registeredProjCtorFields`, modulo saturation (slice P9). Until P9 the invariant had no `Γ.projs` column, and the ι capstone paid for that with the scope restriction `hnoprojs : Γ.projs = ⊥` — which excluded every program touching the typeclass layer. Both are now **derived**, and the restriction is deleted |
| `hdelta : ErasesEnvDeltaData` | the walk's own δ record, converted (slice D5) |
| `hrec : RecEnvConsistent` | the **same** δ record, converted the other way (slice Γ-W4): `recEnvConsistent_of_deltaMem_walked`, modulo the coverage agreement `hcov`. Until Γ-W4 it was discharged by `recEnvConsistent_of_noRec` off the scope restriction `hnorec`, which excluded every recursive program |
| `known` as a free variable | stays free — the fragment (slice D5) |

## Scope note: the cold-start fragment used to be δ-free (slices D1–D5)

Every capstone here was pinned at `known = ⊥`, `Esrc = ⊥` until slice D5, and the reason
was one invariant field:

> `BridgeInv.known_dom` said a `known` constant is *already registered*. At the empty state
> nothing is, so the only sound instantiation was `known = ⊥` — and `Supported.const` needs
> `known n`. The cold-start fragment therefore contained no δ-constant: constructors,
> `casesOn` heads, literals, λ, `let` and application, but no plain constant reference.
> Consequently `Esrc` was empty and the δ records (`SEnvConsistent`, `ErasesEnvDeltaData`,
> `RecEnvConsistent`) were discharged *vacuously* rather than from the walk.

The field is gone (D4a, with `visitMutual`'s motive taking its job), the record now travels
the walk (D4b, `DeltaMem`/`RunConclδ`), and this slice (D5) wires the two into the
capstones. What changed here, precisely:

* `known` and `Esrc` are **parameters**. `gBridgeInv_nil` no longer pins `known`, so the
  entry configuration carries the invariant at any fragment.
* `ErasesEnvDeltaData` is **derived**, not assumed: the bridge's `RunConclδ` transports
  `DeltaMem.empty` to the run's final state, and
  `ColdStartDelta.registeredClosureData_of_deltaMem_walked` converts it.
* The conversion is stated at `Esrc.walked Γ sf.gdecls` — `Esrc` cut down to the constants
  the run's environment really stores a body for. That is what makes the *existence* of
  each registration derivable rather than assumed, and it removes the `KeysDistinct`
  (`hkinj`) premise the design expected to pay here; see `SEnv.walked`. The price is that
  the source-evaluation premise is stated at the restricted environment — the honest place
  for "the program only calls what the walk reached".
* Both residues this slice used to name are **gone**: applied form at δ-N, and
  context-uniformity at δ-D7a/δ-D7b. See the residue list below for what replaced them.

`SEnvConsistent` is **not** derived and should not be: it says the prepared body is defeq
to the kernel's value for the constant, which is a `PrepareHyps`-class fact about the
elaborator, not about the walk. The δ guard at the end of this file discharges it at a
concrete two-declaration environment, from `VEnv`'s own defining equation.

## THE TRUST LEDGER — every premise of the two cold-start capstones, classified

This is the definitive classification for `shipping_erase_correct_firstorder_coldstart`
and its ι twin; the ι rows are marked, everything else is common to both. Read it with
`FirstOrderShippingIota.lean`'s D3ι ledger, which classifies the ι block in more detail.
Four classes, and nothing falls outside them:

* **C — proved-guard-backed certificate.** `rfl`/`decide`-checkable data about a concrete
  `Γ`/`env`, *constructed* in the guards at the end of this file. No run, no opaque
  primitive, no trust.
* **H — runtime Hoare bundle.** A spec for one *real* call on the erasure's path. Never
  an axiom; its global satisfiability is not in-logic decidable because the primitive is
  an opaque `ST`/`EIO` operation. This is the documented trust boundary, the same one
  `BridgeHyps` has carried since the bridge landed.
* **S — scope restriction.** Narrows the class of programs the statement speaks about. A
  violation makes the *premise* unsatisfiable; it never makes the theorem false.
* **R — residue.** Believed, named, not proved. **One** of it, listed after the table —
  down from three at the previous slice.

| premise | class | note |
|---|---|---|
| `hrun : Erasure.erase e cfg … = .ok (p, inls) w'` | — | the subject. No run of the family is constructible in-logic (opaque `CoreM`/`MetaM` primitives, a real `ST.Ref`), so it stays hypothetical in every guard |
| `henv : env.WF` | C | `envFO_wf` / `envδ_wf`, built from lean4lean's own `VDecl.WF` |
| `hUs : Us = []` | S | universe monomorphism of the whole dependency cone. At the *entry point* it is also a fact — `Erasure.run` installs `lparams := []` and `BridgeInv.lparams` pins `ctx.lparams = Us` — but `DeltaHyps.decl_run` demands it of every dependency too, so a polymorphic callee makes the bundle uninhabited (`DeltaHyps`, scope restriction 1). **Costed at Γ-U, and it is not one slice**: `DeltaHyps`' Γ-U analysis walks the five findings, of which two decide it — `Us` is a *parameter* of the bridge theorem rather than a motive binder, so the dependency's sub-run has no composition point at which an `instL` could be inserted (the Γ-W1 pattern would have to be repeated at Γ-W1 scale); and the model's δ step is universe-blind (`SEvalDataι.delta_level_blind`), so `hcon` below — not this row — is where a relaxation would land the vacuity. The row therefore stays, with its cost now measured rather than guessed. **Γ-U1/Γ-U2 landed the half that does not touch it** (2026-08-28): `DeltaHyps.decl_run`, `BlockHyps.block_lparams`, `BridgeInv.lparams` and the oracle's guard now read `ci.levelParams <+: Us`, so the *bundle* stops demanding monomorphism at a polymorphic subject — but this row still pins `Us = []` at the capstone, where `<+: []` **is** `= []` (`DeltaHyps.gPrefixPin_closed_subject`), so not one premise below weakened and nothing moved to `hcon`. What changed is why the row is load-bearing: it used to be doubled by the bundle, and it is now the *only* thing keeping `hcon` inside its sound range. Relaxing it is Γ-U4's job, and it cannot be done without restating `SEnvConsistent` first — but **Γ-U3 removed the other obstacle**: `ErasesInstL.Erases.instL` is a strict level-instantiation transport for erasure on the `max`/`imax`-free non-recursive fragment (the typeclass layer), so the erasure side of a Γ-U4 is no longer a missing lemma and what remains is the model pair (`SEvalDataι.delta`'s level-blindness and `hcon` below). **Γ-U4 landed that pair** (2026-08-28), and this row stopped doing double duty: `SEvalDataι.delta` unfolds at `body.instantiateLevelParams (Γ.lparams n) us`, `hcon` is the `Ups = ⊥` instance of the corrected `SEnvConsistentL`, and the fragment's universe restriction is now the separate `hlp` row below. What this row still says, and now says *only*, is that the **subject** is closed — which the entry point makes a fact (`Erasure.run` installs `lparams := []`). Widening it to `Us ≠ []` is the campaign's completion criterion, and what it needs is named at `hlp` |
| `hcsimp : cfg.csimp = false` | S | csimp replacement is not kernel-semantics-preserving (`PrepareHyps`' own analysis), so it can never sit inside a correctness statement. It is also what makes R2 fire (`ColdStartRun.run_prepare_erasure_state`: with csimp off, `prepare_erasure` leaves the state at `{}`). RAISE-not-fix: the shipping *default* is `csimp := true` |
| `hnfv : Γ.fixvars = ⊥` | S | the subject is outside every mutual block. Also `DeltaHyps.nofixvars` (scope restriction 2) |
| `hcov : … → RecCovered Γ Esrc sf` | H, and S in one conjunct | **the recursion coverage agreement** (Γ-W4), and what the deleted `hnorec : Γ.recBodies = ⊥` traded for. Every constant `Γ` records as recursive is in `Esrc` (that conjunct is S — a fragment-domain condition) and has *its* block stored under its kername in the run's final environment (that one is H — a run-keyed registration agreement, `BridgeInv.knames`-class). It is the **converse** of `Hreg` below and neither derives the other: `RecBlockAgreement` says the block a run builds is the block `Γ` records; this says every block `Γ` records was built. A `Γ` naming a block for a constant the program never calls satisfies the first and not the second. At `Γ.recBodies = ⊥` it is a **theorem** (`ColdStartDelta.RecCovered.of_noRec`), which is how the two `known = ⊥` guards and the δ guard pick it up unchanged. Suppliability: `ColdStartDelta.gRecCoveredD8` and `gRecCoveredFO` compute it on the self-referential fixture at the state a walked recursive exit produces, so the premise is not satisfiable-only-vacuously — the S1d/S1e failure mode. Stated about the run because the final state is what it speaks of, exactly like `hev` |
| `hnat : Γ.natPeano → cfg.nat = .peano` | C | `by simp [Γ…]`; pins the run's config against `Γ`, which is what `Supported.natLit` cashes in |
| `Hr : RegBridgeHyps Γ` | H, and `knames` is C | after S1e it carries only: the naming convention (C), the `Γ`-agreement for a *cold* `register_inductive` (H — the cold branch reads the environment, so no run of it is constructible; the *hit* branch is, which is why the guard is load-bearing: `regShapeHyps_regCtors_refuted`), registration completeness, and the `prepare_erasure` trust item. Registry-invariant preservation is **no longer here** — it is the theorem `ColdStartInduction.visitExpr_regInvShape` |
| `hcon : SEnvConsistent env Us Esrc` | H (`PrepareHyps` class), C at both δ guards | "the prepared body is defeq to the kernel's value for the constant" — a fact about the *elaborator*, not about the walk, so it is deliberately not derived. Discharged at `envδ` from `VEnv`'s own defining equation (`envδ_senvConsistent`), the first non-vacuous instance in this development, and again at the *recursive* guard (`envRec_senvConsistent`) — there by **η**, since that fixture's body is its constant's η-expansion. The second discharge is a property of the fixture, not of recursion: a well-formed `VEnv` cannot carry a self-referential defining equation at all (`VDecl.def` types a constant's value *before* the constant is added), so for a general recursive constant this row is a trust item about a constant whose only kernel form is `_unsafe_rec`. **A second scope conjunct, unnamed until Γ-U**: the predicate quantifies the call site's levels `us` and its conclusion never mentions them, while a `VEnv`'s defining equation (`VEnv.IsDefEq.extra`) instantiates *both* sides. So at a polymorphic constant this row is not the kernel fact but a strictly stronger, false one — it collapses the constant's instantiations (`SEnvConsistent.levels_collapse`). It is sound exactly where `hUs` already puts us, which is why nothing moved; but it means the universe restriction is pinned in two places, and a Γ-U that relaxed only the bundle would move the vacuity here. **Γ-U2 relaxed the bundle and this row still did not move**, because it relaxed it to a *prefix* and `hUs` pins `Us = []`: the widening is real only at a polymorphic subject, and no capstone states one. The prediction stands unrefuted rather than tested — the first capstone stated at `Us ≠ []` is the one that has to restate this row (Γ-U4). **A third conjunct, unnamed until Γ-W5**: at a *mutual* block each member's recorded body is the **other** member's η-expansion, so the predicate forces the two siblings' constants definitionally equal (`SEnvConsistent.siblings_collapse`). Neither existing discharge reaches that — the `envδ` route needs a defining equation a recursive constant has not got, and the `envRec` η route contracts `fun a => g a` to `g`, not to `f` — so an environment satisfying this row at a mutual block has to identify the block's members. That is why `MutualGuard` constructs `hcov` and stops before the capstone. **Γ-U4 repaired the first of the three** (2026-08-28) without moving this row a byte: `SubjectReductionFull.SEnvConsistentL` is the kernel fact at `body.instantiateLevelParams (Ups n) us`, this predicate is *defined* to be its `Ups = fun _ => []` instance (`senvConsistent_iff_l`, `Iff.rfl`), and the simulations consume the general form. So the row's honest reading is fixed — it is the kernel's δ fact **restricted to a universe-monomorphic fragment** — and the restriction is stated at `hlp` below instead of being smuggled in here. `levels_collapse` survives as the cost of that instance rather than as a wall |
| `hlp : Γ.lparams = ⊥` (ι) | S, C everywhere | **the fragment is universe-monomorphic** (slice Γ-U4) — the restriction that used to live inside `hcon`'s quantifier structure, now a `rfl`-checkable equation on a `Γ` column. `ErasureCtx.lparams` is the per-constant `levelParams` map the δ rule instantiates at; it is defaulted `fun _ => []`, so this row is `rfl` at every `ErasureCtx` on a capstone path and no existing discharge moved (the one context in the development whose column is *not* `⊥` is `ErasesDeltaL.ΓPolyδ`, built by that slice's own guards to show the restatement has content). It is what converts `hcon` and `hdelta` into the universe-aware `SEnvConsistentL` / `ErasesEnvDeltaL` the ι simulation now consumes (`.toL`), and it also supplies that simulation's `hrecmono` — a *recursive* fragment constant is monomorphic, which is Γ-U3's named gap (`Erases.instL` refutes rather than transports its two recursive arms) made a premise. Lifting it needs the walk's δ record at each dependency's **own** level scope; `ErasesDeltaL.ErasesEnvDeltaL.of_ownScope` is the step that consumes such a record, and `ColdStartDelta` does not yet produce one |
| `H : BridgeHyps` / `HD : DataBridgeHyps` / `C : CasesBridgeHyps` | H | the three original bundles, unchanged |
| `P : ProjBridgeHyps` | H | the fourth bundle (proj-P8), two clauses for `visitProj`'s two calls. Both are Γ↔environment *registration* agreements and both are `env`/`Us`-free, so **the projection round adds no typing assumption** — it is the same class as `CasesBridgeHyps`, one call site smaller. At `Γ.projs = ⊥` it is a **theorem** (`ProjBridgeHyps.of_bot`), which is what makes threading it through the pre-projection cone cost nothing: at every `Γ` predating the round the bundle is derivable, so the premise adds no assumption to any statement that had none. [Corrected in the coherence pass, 2026-08-27: this row used to say "the eight pre-projection call sites *instantiate* it rather than assuming it". They do not — the cone threads `P` as a hypothesis like the other three bundles, and `of_bot` is applied at exactly one place, the guard at `ProjBridgeHyps.lean`. The claim that cost nothing is *derivability*, not inlining; the guard is what measures it, and `ProjectionGuard` below is where `of_bot` stops applying.] |
| `hproj : ProjConsistent env Us Γ` (ι) | H | the projection interface premise, `hiota`'s exact analogue: the source-side ι rule for `.proj`, stated about `env`. `ProjDischarge.projConsistent_of_coh` discharges it from `ProjDefeqSpec` — upstream's `TrEnv.proj_defeq` — plus `ProjCtorAgree`, plus the `ProjFieldsCoherent` this capstone now derives from the walk. At `Γ.projs = ⊥` it is `projConsistent_of_noProjs`, which is how both `known = ⊥` guards pick it up unchanged. **Not an axiom** at any point: both are `Prop` hypotheses. **The upstream-gated pair became a singleton at the `b6a5a38` re-pin** (2026-08-28), and the two halves moved for different reasons. (i) `ProjCtorAgree` is now a **theorem**, `ProjDischarge.projCtorAgree_of_trEnv`, from a `TrEnv` plus the kernel certificate `ProjRecRules`, on upstream's newly delivered `TrEnv.pats_iota_inv` (the converse of `pats_iota'`, proved and `sorryAx`-free); the derivation is `sorryAx`-free. The fact did not evaporate — upstream declined the specialization (`pats_iota_ctor`) that would have made it premise-free, because `VInductDecl.WF` does not pin the recursor↔inductive boundary — but it **moved off the `VEnv`**, where the round's finding was that no downstream certificate can reach it, onto `kenv`, where `ProjShape` already carries facts of that class and `projRecRules_of_noProjs` shows the new premise is free wherever the projection column is. (ii) `ProjDefeqSpec` had its **statement** corrected upstream — `TrEnv.proj_defeq` is re-stated over `TrProjCtor`, adopted character-identical from this repo's copy, so what this round escalated as "plausibly unprovable, not merely unproved" is now merely unproved — but its **proof is still `sorry`**, with the residual re-analysed as the structure-recursor shape plus ctor-arity threading rather than the ι `pat_uniq` gap. So this row stays, and stays H: `ProjDefeqSpec.of_trEnv` now exists (`ProjPattern.lean`) and is deliberately **not** used here, because using it would bury upstream's deferred proof inside the capstone instead of naming it. It is landed to *price* the row — one printed axiom set, `[propext, sorryAx, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` — not to discharge it |
| `Hδ : DeltaHyps` | H + S | mixed by field, and deliberately: the five `…_run` clauses are H (generator bookkeeping for the `visitMutual`-only primitives); `esrc_sub`/`disj`/`kinj`/`nofixvars`/`decl_run`/`prepared`/`prep_esrc`/`axiom_free`/`esrc_shape` are S (the fragment's own closure conditions). Three field-level changes are worth the ledger: `uniform` is **gone** (δ-D7b) — context-uniformity is now a theorem; `nofixvars` is **conditioned on the fragment** (δ-D8), which makes the bundle inhabitable at a block-local `Γ.withFixvars fv` and costs nothing at a top-level one; and the recursion exclusion `nonrecursive` is **gone** (Γ-W3.6b), traded for the bridge's `Hreg` — the bundle no longer excludes recursive fragment constants. `prep_esrc` also gained a config gate at Γ-W3.6a, which *weakens* what a producer must believe, and `esrc_shape` was weakened at proj-P2 from `NoProj` to `NoProjBinders` — the typeclass layer's prepared bodies are projections, so the strong predicate made the field uninhabitable for all of them; the strong one now sits on `BlockHyps.block_lam`, for the sibling bodies only. A fourth field-level change landed at Γ-W5: `decl_run`'s `ci.all = [m] ∧ remove_unsafe_rec m = n` — the **single-declaration** scope, and the last arity restriction the recursion feature carried — is traded for block-membership closure, the stripped names' `Nodup` and the caller's name among them (`DeltaHyps`' restriction 7). It is a relaxation, not a trade: the old pair implies the three given the field's own `known n`, and the old pair is *false* at any genuine mutual block. A fifth landed at Γ-U2: `decl_run`'s last conjunct is `ci.levelParams <+: Us`, not `= Us` (and `BlockHyps.block_lparams` with it). Also a relaxation, also invisible here — the capstone's `hUs` row pins `Us = []`, where the prefix *is* the equation — and its reach is the **subject** side only: a polymorphic caller with prefix-scoped callees, never a polymorphic callee of a closed subject (`DeltaHyps.gPrefixPin_no_polymorphic_dep`) |
| `Hβ : BlockHyps` | H + S | the block-local companion (Γ-W2), and a premise of the capstones since Γ-W3.6b because step 6 walks the recursive exit. Two run-keyed clauses (H: the sibling fetch's `levelParams`, and `block_esrc` — config-gated at Γ-W3.6a), one scope fact (S: a block source is a projection-free λ — the `NoProj` half arrived at proj-P2, out of `DeltaHyps.esrc_shape`, and keeps this path on the `sorryAx`-free strengthening) and the two residues recursion drags in, `strengthen` (= `hstr`, already in this table) and `nonest`. At `known = ⊥` all three fragment-keyed fields are free (`BlockHyps.of_bot`), which is why the block instantiation pays only the residues. Its scope restriction is named at `RecBlockErasure.erases_rec_block_of_run`: **a block's bodies call only its own siblings, registered constructors and registered `casesOn`s** — the block's inner runs are taken at `known = ⊥`, so an external call is out of scope. That is the one restriction the recursion feature genuinely still makes, and it is *inside* a block rather than about the program |
| `Hreg : RecBlockAgreement` | H | **the walk's registration agreement** (Γ-W3.6b): `Γ` records the block the recursive exit stores, at the readers and states the bridge's induction quantifies. `Erases.fix`'s own premise, and irreducible at a parameter `Γ` fixed before the run builds the block. Its quantifiers are *gated* — on the fragment, and on `BridgeInv`, whose `cfg` field pins the config (Γ-W3.6a) and whose `consts`/`knames` pin the registry — so the two refutations that could be written are closed, and what is left free (`ctx.lctx`, `s.inductives`, the world) is the class every run-keyed field already carries. At `known = ⊥` it is a **theorem** (`RecBlockAgreement.of_bot`). `gRecAgreement` is the suppliability guard; residue 1 records the route that would make it a theorem outright (read `Γ.recBodies` off the run's final `gdecls`, priced at "re-index the erasure relation") |
| `S : ColdStartSubject` | S | one field left. `supported` — the prepared term is in the fragment and lean4lean-translatable, the same premise `DeltaHyps.prepared` makes for the callees. `noBlock`/`noBlockEnv` retired at δ-N |
| `hev : SEvalData{C,ι} … (Esrc.walked Γ sf.gdecls) pe v` | S | the source evaluation, stated about `prepare_erasure e` (what the run erases) and at the walk-restricted environment (what the run registered) |
| `hfo : FirstOrderValue env Us Γ [] v` | S, C at the guards | first-order *result*. Constructed at every guard modulo `harity`, the one lean4lean-blocked side condition `FirstOrder.lean` documents — except at the projection guard (P9), where `ΓprojQ` registers no first-order constructor at all, so no value of the fragment can be exhibited and the premise is taken hypothetically |
| `hiota : IotaConsistent` (ι) | H | the interface premise; `…ι_of_shape` discharges it from `PatsIotaSpec + SEnvConsistent + IotaShape`, at eight further lean4lean *modelling* axioms and no axiom of ours. Since Γ-U4 that route also carries `hlp`, and the reason is stated at `SEvalDataι_defeq_of_shape`: `iotaConsistent_of_shape` δ-unfolds the `casesOn` head and then reasons about the *uninstantiated* recursor value (`IotaShape.shape`'s `hunfold`), so the discharge is available on a monomorphic `Γ` and the general theorem above is not restricted with it |
| `hrel : IotaRelevant` (ι) | S | excludes `Erases` derivations that box a proper prefix of an ι redex; the shipping `visitCases` emits none |
| `hiacoh : IotaArityCoherent` (ι) | C | `ΓFOι_iotaArityCoherent` |
| `hcc` (ctor/`casesOn` disjointness) | C | `ΓFOι_cc` |
| `hstr : ErasableStrengthen env Us` | **R** | the only one left. A three-line `VExpr`-level statement — `HasType.weakN_inv` for the shipping `VEnv.HasType`. Commissioned upstream as C1 and **NOT discharged**, twice: the trproj round returned a written analysis arguing the route is blocked, and round 2 (`b6a5a38`) re-asked and returned the same verdict with no partial variant found. See residue 2 below |

**Derived from the run, and therefore absent from the list above** — the `ErasureState`,
the environment `E`, `ClosedEnv E`, `LBClosed t 0`, the bridge invariant, the five
registration records (three data columns, and since P9 the two projection ones),
`ErasesEnvDeltaData`, `RecEnvConsistent`, the `Program` shape, and
(since S1e) the registry invariant's preservation. `PrepareHyps.prepare_sound` is derived
too: it is the theorem `ColdStartRun.prepare_sound_of_prepareHyps`, so that bundle is down
to three fields. `ColdStartInduction.RegShapeHyps` is **not used at all** — it is refuted
below, three ways.

**The residues: one, and who owes it.**

0. **How to read this list.** The repo keeps a refuted or retired item next to its record
   rather than deleting it, so the three entries below are the three the previous slice
   named. Only **one** is still a residue, and only one is a capstone premise of class R:
   `hstr : ErasableStrengthen env Us`, inside entry 2.

1. ~~`EnvErasureRec.RegisteredClosureRec`~~ — the δ witness for a *recursive* block.
   **DEMOTED, slice δ-D8**, and never a capstone premise: `hnorec` (S) stood in for it, so
   it always cost scope rather than trust.

   Slice D6 walked the recursive exit's `List.mapM` and supplied most of
   `erases_fix_of_open`'s premise list from the run. What was left was `hopen` at the
   block-local `Γ.withFixvars fv` — filed as "the `Γ`-inside-the-motives generalisation",
   design §W3.2/D8 — and `hreg`. The first turned out **not to need any motive change**:
   `visitExpr_refines_erases` binds `Γ` as a plain implicit and `VisitExprRefines` declares
   no `variable`, so it is Γ-polymorphic *as a statement*, and of its premises exactly one
   breaks at a block-local `Γ`: `DeltaHyps.nofixvars`, which asserted `Γ.fixvars = ⊥`
   unconditionally and is now conditioned on the fragment — the only thing its two
   consumption sites ever had in scope. Hence
   `VisitExprRefines.visitExpr_refines_erases_block`,
   `RecBlockErasure.erases_rec_block_of_run` and
   `ColdStartDelta.recEnvConsistent_of_block`: the record's `erase` field is now *derived*.

   What survives is not an `Erases` certificate but a **registration agreement** — "the `Γ`
   you supply names *this* block, under the map the run installed" (`hreg`/`hfv`/`hcov`) —
   irreducible at a parameter `Γ`, which is fixed before the run builds `defs`, and of the
   same class as `BridgeInv.knames`; plus `hnd` (freshness, `BridgeHyps.fresh_run`'s
   business) and the standing `hnest` residue of `Erases.instFixvars`. The price is a named
   scope restriction: **a block's bodies call only its own siblings, registered
   constructors and registered `casesOn`s** — the block's inner runs are taken at
   `known = ⊥`, so an external call is out of scope.

   **`hnorec` did not trade for this at δ-D8e, and the reason is worth keeping** — the
   proximate gate was a premise with a name of its own: `DeltaHyps.nonrecursive` demanded
   `name_occurs n v = false` of every fragment name, which forces `visitMutual`'s
   `nonrecursive` test `true`, so the bridge's step 6 *refuted* the recursive exit rather
   than walking it. δ-D8e split that clause out of `decl_run` — a restriction on the
   fragment, not a fact about the fetch — so that the trade would be a **one-field trade**
   rather than surgery on a five-conjunct spec.

   **Slice Γ-W3.6b made the trade.** The field is deleted; step 6 walks the exit. What it
   traded for is one named premise of the bridge, `VisitExprRefines.RecBlockAgreement`, of
   the `block_esrc` class — a Hoare-style agreement over runs, gated on the fragment and on
   `BridgeInv` — plus the `Hβ : BlockHyps` bundle the walk already needed. So the bridge's
   half of this row is **paid**, and what remains is the capstone half (below).

   The δ-D8e plan for the rest — "the `δ` transport across `recConstState` composes, plus
   the block loop's generator bookkeeping, plus the `remove_unsafe_rec` scope restriction"
   — was **incomplete, and the missing item was structural.** Removing `nonrecursive` lets
   the run *reach* the recursive exit; on its own it does not let the bridge *walk* it. Inside `visitExpr_refines_erases_core` the exit's per-sibling erasures are
   runs of the induction's **abstract** fixpoint argument, so the only thing available
   about them is the motives — and the motives fix one `Γ`. The exit runs each sibling
   under the reader carrying the block's fixvar map, while `BridgeInv.fixvars` is an *iff*
   against `Γ.fixvars`, which `DeltaHyps.nofixvars` pins at `⊥` for a fragment name. The
   erasure IH's own premise is therefore **false** at that reader:
   `VisitExprRefines.bridgeInv_blockReader_refuted`, with the instance at the block reader
   itself, `bridgeInv_rec_exit_reader_refuted`.

   So the `Γ`-inside-the-motives generalisation, which δ-D8 correctly reported was
   unnecessary for the bridge theorem *as a statement*, is still necessary *inside* the
   induction, and it is what this row is really waiting on. Concretely, in order:
   quantify `(known, Γ, Esrc)` and the four trust bundles inside all eighteen motives (≈40
   IH application sites, ≈30 bundle uses); a `List.mapM` decomposition for the block loop
   that **chains** states and worlds — `ColdStartRun.run_rec_exit_siblings` is
   deliberately `gw`-free and hands its per-sibling runs back at unrelated states, which is
   exactly what a `BridgeInv` cannot be rebuilt from; the transport of the *outer* δ record
   across the block's inner runs (they register no constant body, but nothing states that
   yet); the block-local `Supported`/`TrExprS`/`Esrc` premises for the sibling bodies,
   which the `known = ⊥` bundle cannot supply because every one of its scope fields is
   keyed on `known n`; and the `remove_unsafe_rec` scope restriction, which is real —
   `DeltaHyps.rec_exit_registers_stripped_name` shows motive 6's conclusion is *false*, not
   merely unproved, at an `._unsafe_rec` name. `ColdStartDelta`'s recursion section carries
   the premise-by-premise ledger for everything downstream of that.

   **Status of that list after slices Γ-W0/W1/W2** — five landed, one narrowed, one
   dissolved, one found. The generalisation is **narrower** than priced: only `Γ` moved, as
   a bound variable plus a one-equation coherence hypothesis, and `known`, `Esrc` and all
   four bundles stayed outer (Γ-W1; 34 signature edits, 33 IH sites, 0 admissibility
   edits). The chaining loop rule is `Erasure.run_rec_exit_siblings_chained`, and the fresh
   ids come back `Nodup` from `Erasure.run_mkFreshFVarId_list` (Γ-W0). The outer δ record's
   transport **dissolved**: indexing `RunConclδ` at the ambient `Γ₀` rather than at the
   motive-local `Γ` means the inner runs are *allowed* to register things and the record
   carries them (Γ-W1); `DeltaMem.recBlock`/`RunConclδ.recBlock` are the extension step.
   The block-local scope premises are `DeltaHyps.BlockHyps` (Γ-W2), five fields rather than
   the seven priced — and keyed on `known (remove_unsafe_rec m)`, because the loop's `m`
   ranges over `ci.all`. The `remove_unsafe_rec` restriction was **not** real in the
   direction recorded above: the suffix rides on the *fetched* declaration, not on the
   caller's name, so the repair was to relax `decl_run` to `ci.all = [m] ∧
   remove_unsafe_rec m = n` (Γ-W2a) — after which the fragment *gains* the arithmetic the
   §H benchmarks need, which is the opposite of a restriction. **And the surviving half of
   that pair went at Γ-W5**: `ci.all = [m]` was the single-declaration scope, unnumbered
   and inside a five-conjunct field, and it is replaced by the three facts the walk
   consumes — block-membership closure, the stripped names' `Nodup`, and the caller's name
   among them (`DeltaHyps`' restriction 7). The relaxation costs nothing at arity one
   (`gDeclRunMutual_of_single`) and the old conjunct was outright false at arity two
   (`gDeclRunSingle_mutual_refuted`). And one item the list did
   not have at all: the four block results lived **downstream** of `VisitExprRefines`, so
   step 6 could not call them; Γ-W2 moved their cone into `RecBlockErasure.lean`, verbatim,
   below the bridge.

   **And the branch itself, after Γ-W3 — the walk is written, and one premise is not
   dischargeable inside the induction.** `VisitExprRefines.rec_exit_refines_erases` walks
   the exit at an *abstract* eraser and its motive-1 refinement hypothesis, which is
   exactly the shape step 6 holds, and derives all three conjuncts of `visitMutual`'s
   motive: the two loops, the per-sibling `BridgeInv` rebuild at the block-local
   `Γ₀.withFixvars fv`, the `Δ → []` strengthening, `erases_rec_block_of_run` and
   `RunConclδ.recBlock`. Guard (iv') fires it at the shipping eraser through the induction
   itself. Two rows of the list above were *wrong* about where facts come from, and both
   were repaired in `RecBlockErasure`/`Closed`: the block bodies' de-Bruijn closedness is
   **not** `ColdStartInduction.visitExpr_noFix_closed` — at an abstract eraser no output
   shape exists, and no motive carries one — but `erases_target_lbClosed`, read off the
   `Erases` derivation; and `Erases.fix`'s `hrarg` needed `Erasure.run_mkDef_rarg`, which
   `run_mkDef_ok` did not state.

   What is left is **one premise**: `hreg`, the agreement that `Γ` records *this* block
   for its own names. `Γ` is fixed before the run builds `defs`, so no run fact inside the
   induction can pin it. Γ-W3 found it stated at the induction's abstract eraser, where
   every phrasing is *contradictory* — two erasers, two blocks, one `Γ.recBodies`
   (`VisitExprRefines.rec_exit_agreement_eraser_quantified_refuted`) — and priced the
   route out of that at Γ-W3c.

   **That route was paid, at Γ-W3.5, and it bought what it said it would.** Every motive
   of `visitExpr_refines_erases_core` now carries a second conjunct, `f ⊑ Erasure.visitXxx`
   in `partial_fixpoint`'s own order; the eighteen admissibility obligations are the
   eighteen old ones wrapped in `Erasure.admissible_and_le`, and the eighteen step
   obligations are four lines each off
   `Erasure.visitExpr.mutual._proof_1 : Lean.Order.monotone …`, the monotonicity proof
   `partial_fixpoint` generated for the erasure family. `rec_exit_refines_erases`' `hreg`
   is consequently stated at the **shipping** `Erasure.visitExpr`
   (`VisitExprRefines.RecBlockRegistered`), and the walk still consumes it at an abstract
   eraser because `Erasure.run_rec_exit_siblings_le` transports the sibling loop's
   successful run from one to the other. Guard (iv'') fires the whole composition at
   exactly the data step 6 holds. One correction to Γ-W3c's wording: the conjunct cannot
   be the run-ok implication it named — run-ok agreement is strictly weaker than `⊑`
   (`EST.bot` is an `.error`) and is not preserved by the erasure functional's step, so
   the motives carry `⊑` and `Erasure.run_ok_of_le` is its corollary.

   **The wall that was left after Γ-W3.5 was a different one, and Γ-W3.6 took it down.**
   `hreg` is stated at *a* reader and *a* state; step 6's motive quantifies both, so a
   premise handed to the induction from outside has to quantify them too. That was not the
   eraser wall again: it was never provably contradictory — there is only one eraser now,
   so the two-blocks argument has nothing to run on — but it was not *suppliable* either,
   because readers differing in `Erasure.Config` erase the same block to different `defs`
   and the only reader/`Γ` coherence available was `BridgeInv.natcfg`, which is
   one-directional.

   Γ-W3.6a supplied the missing coherence, and it turned out to be one field: config is a
   **run invariant** — none of the eraser's five `withReader` sites touches it,
   `{ … with config := … }` occurs nowhere, and the only fresh reader is `Erasure.run`'s
   own — so `BridgeInv` can carry `cfg : ctx.config = cfg₀` at the cost of five transport
   lines and no proof obligation at all. With the config pinned and the registry pinned by
   `consts`/`knames`, the reader/state quantifier admits no refutation, and Γ-W3.6b landed
   the premise: `VisitExprRefines.RecBlockAgreement`, of the `block_esrc` class.
   `DeltaHyps.nonrecursive` is **deleted** and step 6's `case isFalse` is a walk, not an
   `absurd`. The same slice re-gated `prep_esrc` and `block_esrc` on the config, which
   removes a defect those two *shipped* with since Γ-W2.

   **And the other `case isFalse` — the `single_decl` one — became a walk at Γ-W5.** With
   `decl_run` no longer pinning `ci.all = [m]`, a multi-declaration block is in scope, and
   the branch that used to be an `absurd` off `hall` is ten lines. The shipping eraser
   makes it the *shorter* path, not the longer one: `single_decl` guards the whole
   `@[inline]`/`value?`/`isExtern` prefix and `nonrecursive` is `single_decl && …`, so at
   `ci.all.length ≠ 1` the run goes straight to the block exit — no prefix, no second
   `getEnv`, no `logInfo` steps, no axiom exits, and one unreachable sub-branch to refute.
   `rec_exit_refines_erases` and `RecBlockAgreement` were arity-general already, which is
   why the walk itself did not change at all; the single-declaration arm got *shorter*
   too, losing the three `have`s that used to build the walk's side conditions out of
   `hall`/`hstrip`. Guard (iv'''') fires the walk at a two-member block asked for its
   *second* sibling, and `DeltaHyps`' `ΓfixMut`/`gMutualNames` fixtures are the first in
   the development that can tell `closeFix`'s and `fixSubst`'s orderings apart.

   **And the capstone half landed at Γ-W4, which closes the row.** `hnorec` is deleted from
   both capstones. What replaced it is `hcov : RecCovered Γ Esrc sf` (see the table) and one
   conversion, `ColdStartDelta.recEnvConsistent_of_deltaMem_walked`, which is
   `registeredClosureData_of_deltaMem_walked` with the applied-form conjunct dropped and the
   coverage agreement added — so it consumes the *same three arguments* the capstone already
   assembles for its `ErasesEnvDeltaData`, and the recursive record costs exactly one new
   premise and no new machinery.

   Two predictions in this row were wrong, and both in the cheap direction. It said the
   capstone half needs `recEnvConsistent_of_block`: it does not — that theorem takes a block
   apart index by index and carries a single-block restriction, while the conversion the
   capstones actually take is keyed per name on `Γ.recBodies n` and has **none** (a `Γ`
   describing several blocks costs nothing; what stays single-declaration is the *subject*).
   And it said the `.fix` registration has to be "carried into" the δ record: it was already
   there. `DeltaMem` is keyed on the recorded entry and says nothing about its shape, so a
   `.fix` body was inside its statement from D4b onwards; `DeltaMem.recBlock` (Γ-W0) is what
   puts one there, and the walked exit fires it.

   The guard is `ColdStart`'s `RecursiveGuard` section: the cold-start entry point at a `Γ`
   where the deleted premise is *refuted* (`ΓFOrec_norec_refuted`).

   Slice `rec` repaired the theorem this entry is about. `erases_fix_of_open`'s `hopen`
   quantified over *every* `Δf`, and in that form it is **unsatisfiable for every
   self-referential block** — `Erases.fixvar` is the only rule taking a `.const` source to
   an `.fvar` target, and its `hfresh` is anti-monotone in `Δ`. It had no non-vacuity
   guard, which was the tell: the file's own fixture carries exactly the missing side
   condition and so could never feed it. `hopen` is now conditioned on a fresh `Δf`,
   `Erases.fix`'s unrestricted `hbodies` is rebuilt through `[]` with `erases_weak_any`,
   and `gErases_fix_of_open` is the guard it never had. Slice δ-D8 finished the job: the
   proof instantiates `hopen` at `Δf := []` and nowhere else, so `erases_fix_of_open_nil`
   states it there — a strictly weaker premise, and the only one a *run* can supply.
2. `DeltaHyps.uniform` — context-uniformity (`∀ Δ`) of a constant body's erasure. The
   bridge fires at the `Δ` of the call site, and `RegisteredClosure*.erase` needs every
   `Δ`.

   **The blame was misplaced** (slice δ-D7a). This row used to say the gap was "a
   lean4lean-side `TrExprS`-weakening obligation"; `TrExprS.weakFV`
   (`Verify/Typing/Lemmas.lean:596`) has been proved upstream all along. The
   **weakening** half is now a theorem of this development with no residue at all:
   `ErasesStrengthen.erases_weakFV` (along a `VLCtx.FVLift`) and
   `ErasesStrengthen.erases_weak_any` (out of `[]` into *every* `VLCtx`, for a closed,
   fvar-free source and a closed target — the shape `Erases.fix`'s unrestricted `∀ Δf`
   demands). Two corrections fell out of proving them, both recorded at the lemmas:
   lean4lean's `weakFV` asks for `VLCtx.WF` of the target context, which the `lam`/`letE`
   cases cannot re-establish (`Erases.lam` carries no `IsType` for its binder type) and
   which is more than the proof consumes — `VLCtx.FVWF` suffices and conses freely; and
   at an unrestricted `Δ` even `FVWF` is unavailable, where fvar-*freeness* of the source
   removes the hypothesis outright, since no `.inr` lookup ever happens.

   What is left is the **other** direction, `Δ → []`, and it is not about `Erases` or
   about `TrExprS` either: it is `Erasable`/`HasType` **strengthening**, the inverse of
   `weakN`. lean4lean has `HasType.weakN_inv` for the *stratified* theories only; the
   shipping `VEnv.HasType` used by `Verify/Typing` has no such lemma. That is the whole
   of residue 2, stated at the `VExpr` level — which makes it a contribution to lean4lean
   rather than a debt of this development. The `Δ` the record starts from now travels
   with its own well-formedness and `NoBV` (slice δ-D7b(i), `DeltaMem`), so nothing else
   stands between the premise and its discharge.

   **Discharged** (slice δ-D7b). `ErasesUniform.erases_strengthen_closed` does the
   `Δ → []` direction and `erases_uniform_closed` composes the two, so the field is
   deleted from `DeltaHyps` and the capstones call the theorem. What is left is the
   premise `hstr : ErasableStrengthen env Us`, a three-line statement at the `VExpr`
   level and the only R-class row in the table above. Two things the bundle owes it are
   S-class and now written down: `DeltaHyps.esrc_shape` (a fragment body is
   projection-free *at its binders* and translates at `[]` — since slice P2 the predicate
   is `NoProjBinders`, which admits the typeclass layer's `fun α x self => self.1` and
   pays for the boxed positions with `TrExprS.uniq` instead of `TrExprS.unique`; the
   recursive exit keeps the strong `NoProj` for its siblings, `BlockHyps.block_lam`), and
   the context data `DeltaMem` now carries (δ-D7b(i)).

   Honest note on the upstream side, established while proving this: lean4lean does
   **not** have `HasType.weakN_inv` even for the stratified theories — those statements
   sit inside comment blocks whose supporting `IsDefEq.weakN_inv` has `sorry` arms — and
   for the shipping `VEnv.HasType` the corresponding `IsDefEqU.weakN_iff`
   (`Theory/Typing/UniqueTyping.lean`) is itself a `sorry`. So discharging `hstr` from
   what upstream has today would import a gap rather than close one. Naming it keeps the
   gap where a reader can see it.

   **Asked for upstream, and answered — in the negative (2026-08-27, pin `fee3ada`).**
   This was commission item C1. It did not close, and the round delivered the sanctioned
   alternative: a written analysis of *where* it breaks, which is a better result than a
   reshaped `sorry`. The line `UniqueTyping.lean:174` is byte-identical to the ι head —
   no new statement, no renamed gap, no freshly-sorried `HasType.weakN_inv` exported for
   us to consume. The analysis:

   * strengthening inducts on the `IsDefEq` derivation and every structural case goes
     through, `defeqDF` included (`IsDefEqU` discards the type);
   * `trans` is the irreducible obstruction — the middle term of a conversion chain is an
     arbitrary `VExpr`, not a lift, so neither IH applies;
   * eliminating `trans`-intermediates is what confluence buys, and the confluence route
     is blocked **two independent ways**: a module import cycle (`ChurchRosser.lean`
     *imports* `UniqueTyping.lean`, so `weakN_iff` sits structurally upstream of all
     reduction machinery), and a same-measure logical cycle (`weakN_iff` is called
     non-reflexively at the same size from the confluence development itself, with no
     evident well-founded measure — `Prop`-impredicativity and `imax` defeat level
     measures);
   * and the sharpest finding, which we had not predicted: closing the `church_rosser`
     `pat` `IOTA-TODO` would be **necessary but not sufficient**. Landing ι-confluence
     does not unblock C1.

   **Re-asked at round 2, and answered the same way (2026-08-28, pin `b6a5a38`).** C1 was
   item 3 of `upstream-round2.md`, marked lowest priority and expected to stay open, and
   it did: `UniqueTyping.lean:172` is untouched, no partial variant was found, and round
   2's analysis agrees with round 1's line for line. Two rounds of independent attempts
   put the same verdict on it, which is the strongest evidence available that this is a
   genuine research gap in the upstream development rather than an unworked lemma.

   So `hstr` **stays a named premise**, and this row stays class R. That is the standing
   recommendation from both sides now, not an assumption of ours. The complementary
   observation is that its cost stopped growing: the `Δ → []` half is a theorem here, and
   since `TrProj` got a real definition (pin `fee3ada`) nothing else in this ledger
   inherits anything from the projection cluster.
3. ~~`ColdStartSubject.noBlock` / `noBlockEnv`~~ — **RETIRED, slice δ-N.** The stated
   obstruction ("not carryable by the shape induction") was a misdiagnosis, and the
   refutation is one line of the definition: `NoBlock` (`ErasesCorrectData.lean`) is
   `True` on `.box` — boxing is *invisible* to it — and `False` on exactly one node,
   `.construct _ _ (_ :: _)`. The eraser has exactly one `.construct` construction site
   (`Erasure.visitConstructor`), and it is **nullary by explicit design**: "in the stage
   of λbox I am targeting constructor application is function application". So `NoBlock`
   is true of every `visitExpr` output for a structural reason, and the shape induction
   carries it as `ShapeC`'s third conjunct alongside `NoFix`/`LBClosed`
   (`visitExpr_shape_all`). At the environment level `NoBlockEnv` is a `RunClosed`
   predicate (`ColdStartDelta.runClosed_noBlockEnv`): `inl` leaves `gdecls` alone,
   `addAxiom` conses a value-less entry, `register_inductive` conses an `.inductiveDecl`
   over a `ConstExt` prefix of value-less entries, and the two constant conses are handed
   the body's `NoBlock` by the widened `RunClosed.nrc`/`rc`. Only the standing
   `prepare_erasure` transparency item is assumed, and `DeltaHyps.prep_run` already
   states it. `ColdStartSubject` is down to a single field.

Nothing in this ledger is an axiom of ours. The measured axiom sets of both capstones are
`shipping_erase_correct_firstorder`'s **verbatim** — the three standard Lean axioms plus
`sorryAx` and the four `Lean.Expr`/`PersistentHashMap` modelling axioms, all inherited
through lean4lean.

## THE INHERITED BOUNDARY — what `sorryAx` means here (re-measured 2026-08-27, `fee3ada`/`7a5e96d`)

The pin moved from the ι head `1a1ebe8` to `fee3ada` and then to `7a5e96d`, head of the
fork's `trproj` branch, where **`TrProj` stops being a `sorry`** (and, at `7a5e96d`, its
motive is pinned to the constant — a step that discharged no `sorry` and added no axiom,
so every measurement in this section stands at both revisions). That single change is
worth stating precisely, because for a year the honest answer to "what does the `sorryAx`
in these capstones stand for?" was partly wrong.

**What it never was.** `TrProj` used to be a `sorry`-valued *definition*, so `sorryAx`
entered through the **type** of `TrExprS` — every statement mentioning `Erases` or
`TrExprS` carried it whether or not its proof touched a projection. `#print axioms
Lean4Lean.TrProj` now reads `[propext]`, and with that channel closed **111 declarations
in `scratch/final_audit.lean` lost `sorryAx` outright**, entries carrying it going 230 →
91. Chief among them: `visitExpr_refines_erases` — the claim that the shipping eraser
refines this development's `Erases` relation — is now **sorryAx-free**, as are
`BridgeInv` and all its transports, `DeltaHyps`, `DeltaMem`, `RunConclδ`,
`ColdStartSubject`, `RecEnvConsistent`, the whole δ registration chain, and every
`Erases` transport and inversion lemma. The *refinement* half of this development inherits
nothing but modelling axioms.

**What it actually is, and what the capstones still pay.** Their set is verbatim
unchanged, and the `sorryAx` in it is **unique typing**, not projections:

* `Lean4Lean.TrExprS.uniq` → `Lean4Lean.TrProj.uniq`, still `PROJ-TODO`. 69 call sites of
  `.uniq` downstream — 31 in `ErasesCorrectData.lean`, then `ErasesCorrect.lean` (11),
  `ErasesCorrectIota.lean` (7), `ErasesUniform.lean` (4), `FirstOrder.lean` (2),
  `ErasesStrengthen.lean` (2), `SubjectReductionFull.lean` (1). The densest single line of
  inherited debt we carry. [Census flagged in the coherence pass, 2026-08-27: taken at the
  `fee3ada` re-pin, the per-file figures sum to 58 rather than 69 and a grep today
  disagrees with both — `ErasesUniform.lean` alone now leads, on the proj-P2 sites named
  just below. **Due a re-measure**; nothing about the attribution in this bullet depends on
  the number.] Slice proj-P2 added one more call site, deliberately and
  *without* widening the reach: admitting projections into the fragment means the
  `Δ → []` strengthening can no longer use the `sorry`-free `TrExprS.unique` (uniqueness
  at `.proj` is false, not unproved), so the weak-predicate lemma
  `Erases.strengthen_fvlift_binders` uses `.uniq` — while the equational lemma is **kept**
  for the recursive exit, which is what leaves `visitExpr_refines_erases` and
  `rec_exit_refines_erases` `sorryAx`-free. The audit prefix was byte-identical across that
  slice, at its size then (750 entries; the audit has grown to 856 since).
* `Lean4Lean.VEnv.IsDefEq.uniqU`, sorried through `IsDefEqU.weakN_iff` (= C1, see residue
  2) and through the ι fork's `pat` cases. It reaches us via `TrProj.defeqDFC`,
  `TrExpr.app`/`TrExpr.proj` and `TrExprS.instL`.
* `Lean4Lean.VEnv.HasType.app_inv` (`Theory/Typing/Strong.lean`) — the ι spine
  construction.
* `Lean4Lean.Aligned.addInduct` — the ι fork's environment-alignment `IOTA-TODO`.

**The remaining upstream projection items — the PROJ-TODO trio.** Three, and only one has
downstream reach:

| item | upstream site | reaches us? |
|---|---|---|
| `TrProj.uniq` | `Verify/Typing/Lemmas.lean` | **YES**, through `TrExprS.uniq` (above). Blocked on the `Injectivity.lean` cluster, never in scope for the trproj round |
| `TrProj.weak'_inv` | `Verify/Typing/Lemmas.lean` | **no** — nothing here calls `TrExprS.weakFV'_inv`/`weakFV_inv`. `ErasesUniform.lean` deliberately routed around it, and that decision pays off twice: it dodged the A0 churn *and* this gap. Blocked on C1 |
| `TrEnv.proj_defeq` | `Verify/Environment/Lemmas.lean` | **priced, not paid** — a real statement with a deferred proof. Its *statement* was corrected at the `b6a5a38` re-pin (re-stated over `TrProjCtor`, adopted verbatim from this repo's copy), so what this round escalated as plausibly unprovable is now merely unproved; upstream also re-analysed the residual as the structure-recursor shape plus ctor-arity threading, explicitly **not** the ι `pat_uniq` gap. Since the re-pin exactly one downstream declaration reaches it — `ProjDefeqSpec.of_trEnv`, landed deliberately and used by nothing — so it contributes `sorryAx` to that entry and to no other, and to no capstone. That is the design call made explicitly: name the price, do not pay it |

**And what the merge cost.** `trproj` is a merge of upstream `master`, so this pin also
absorbs master's level-normalization rewrite, the K-target flag fix and
`lazyDeltaProjReduction` — about 5,200 lines of change nobody here commissioned. Two
axioms enter the audited surface with it: `Std.TreeMap.all_eq_all_toList`, a genuinely new
`axiom` in lean4lean's `Verify/Axioms.lean` (standing in for a `Std` lemma Lean does not
prove yet, leanprover/lean4#12798), and `Lean.Level.isExplicitSubsumedAux_eq`, declared
upstream already but unreached until now. Both land on the **executable kernel-checker**
cluster only — `TypeChecker.kernel_isErasable_sound`, `ResidualHyps.toBridgeHyps`,
`shipping_visitExpr_correct'` — and neither touches the capstones or the ι `_of_shape`
cluster. The commissioned commits themselves add no `axiom`.

/-! ## A refuted premise, and what replaced it

Slice S1d collected the registration-side side conditions of the shape argument in
`ColdStartInduction.RegShapeHyps`, and `visitExpr_regInvShape` carried the registry
invariant through a whole run *given that record*. **The record is inconsistent**, so at
slice S4 those three corollaries (`visitExpr_regInvShape`, `visitMutual_regInvShape`,
`get_constant_kername_regInvShape`) were vacuous and could not discharge anything.

Slice S1e repaired that — see `ColdStartInduction`'s "`RegInvShape` is `RunClosed`"
section — and the corollaries below are the repaired ones, consuming `RegBridgeHyps`. The
refutations stay as the negative guards they always were, and the record they refute stays
with them, unused.

Three independent refutations, all proved below:

* `regShapeHyps_fresh_refuted` — `fresh` quantifies over **every** state satisfying the
  invariant, with no link to the call being made. `RegInvShape Γ (addAxiomState n {})` is
  a *theorem* (S1's own `RegInvShape.addAxiom` at the empty state), and in that state
  `Erasure.toKername n` is already a key, so `fresh` at that state and that name asserts
  `Kername.beq (toKername n) (toKername n) = false`.
* `regShapeHyps_recClosed_refuted` — `recClosed` asserts `LBClosed (.fix defs j) 0` for
  **every** `defs`, and a one-definition block whose body is `.bvar 5` is not closed.

* `regShapeHyps_regCtors_refuted` (slice S1e) — `regCtors` is keyed on a
  `register_inductive` run with no branch guard, and the *hit* branch's run is
  constructible from `run_get`/`run_pure`, so the field can be instantiated at a hand-made
  state whose `gdecls` is empty. `regKeys`/`regCases`/`regFields` fall the same way.

### What the repair turned out to be (slice S1e)

The repair spec written here at S4 was right about the two moving parts and wrong about
the diagnosis. Both parts landed:

1. a **coverage** field in `RegInvShape` (`ConstKeysCovered`), which needed
   `Erasure.run_register_inductive_cold_ok`'s `ConstExt` to record the *keys* of its
   `@[extern]`-constructor axiom prefix — it now does;
2. `RunClosed.rc` **takes** the closedness of the block it is storing, supplied by
   `Erasure.run_rec_exit_ok` from `run_mkDef_ok` plus the binder-fold arithmetic.

But coverage does not restore key *distinctness*, and no side condition could:
`ColdStartInduction.runClosed_keysDistinct_refuted` shows a `RunClosed` predicate cannot
contain `KeysDistinct` at all, because `nrc` is a bare state closure. So `RegInvShape`'s
`keys` field is gone, coverage stands in its place, and the freshness the design called
`hkinj` is now a *derived* fact for a not-yet-registered name
(`RegInvShape.fresh_of_unregistered`) rather than a premise.

With that, `visitExpr_regInvShape` is a theorem again and S4's `RegBridgeHyps.regInv`
field — which stated its conclusion, keyed on a run, to route around the vacuity — is
gone. What remains in `RegBridgeHyps` is what `Γ` being a parameter really costs: the
naming convention, the `Γ`-agreement for a cold `register_inductive`, the completeness
facts, and the `prepare_erasure` trust item. -/

/-- **`RegShapeHyps` is inconsistent (i).** Its `fresh` field, instantiated at the state
S1's own `RegInvShape.addAxiom` produces, asserts that a kername differs from itself. -/

  have := Hg.fresh (n := `x) hinv (toKername `x, .constantDecl ⟨none⟩) (by simp [addAxiomState])
  simp at this

/-- **`RegShapeHyps` is inconsistent (ii)** — independently of (i). `recClosed` ranges
over *every* block, including one whose single body is a loose de Bruijn index. -/

  have := Hg.recClosed [{ name := .anon, body := .bvar 5 }] 0
  simp [LBClosedDefs] at this

/-! ### …and (iii): the unguarded `register_inductive` fields

Slice S4 asserted this one without formalising it; slice S1e formalises it, because it is
what forces the cold guard in the repaired bundle. A one-name inductive, a state that
already knows it (so the call takes the *hit* branch and returns unchanged), and an empty
`gdecls`: `Erasure.run_register_inductive_hit_mk` builds that run out of `get`/`pure`
alone, and `regCtors` then claims a block registration in the empty environment.

Note the `Γ` here records a constructor — which is the point. At a `Γ` with no
constructors these fields are vacuous, so the refutation needs (and uses) the only kind of
`Γ` the capstone is interesting at. -/

/-! ## The subject bundle

`Erasure.erase` runs `visitExpr (← prepare_erasure e)`, so every fact a capstone needs
about "the term being erased" is a fact about the **prepared** term, which the run
produces and the statement cannot name. They are collected here, each quantified over the
prepare run that produces it.

`PrepareHyps.prepare_sound` is what relates the prepared term's source evaluation back to
`e`'s; it is stated for `SEvalData`, so the `SEvalDataι`/`SEvalDataC` flavours the
capstones use are taken directly about the prepared term. -/

/--
**Cold-start D3ι — the shipping eraser, from the entry point.** For a source `e` whose
prepared form is supported, lean4lean-translatable and `SEvalDataι`-evaluates to a
first-order value `v`: a successful `Erasure.erase e cfg` (csimp off) returns
`Program.untyped E (some t)` for an environment `E` and a term `t` **it built itself**,
and `t` `WcbvEval`-uates at `appliedFlags` to *the* unique applied-form erasure of `v`.

No `ErasureState`, no `E`, no registration record and no bridge invariant is supplied
from outside: they are produced by `ColdStartRun.erase_run_ok` (R1),
`ColdStartRun.run_prepare_erasure_state` (R2), `ColdStartShape.RegInvShape.empty` and
`ColdStartInduction.visitExpr_regInvShape`. What survives is documented in the module
docstring's ledger.

/-! ## The `hnorec` trade — made, and what it cost

Slice δ-D8e checked whether the capstones could drop `hnorec` *then*, taking the
registration agreement (`hcov`: "`Γ` records as recursive only blocks the run really
stored") in its place and deriving `RecEnvConsistent` from the δ record the walk already
carries. They could not, and the reason is worth keeping, because the change would have
*looked* like a widening while being none.

`DeltaMem` is keyed on the recorded entry and says nothing about its shape, so a `.fix`
entry is inside its statement already — that half composes. What did not was the supply:
the only exit that ever cons a `.constantDecl ⟨some (.fix …)⟩` is the recursive one, which
`DeltaHyps.nonrecursive` refuted on the fragment, and the *non-recursive* exit provably
cannot produce one — it stores a `visitExpr` output, and those are `NoFix`
(`nonrec_exit_stores_no_fix` below). So at a cold start no `.fix` entry existed, an `hcov`
premise phrased on membership was uninhabited for every `n` with `Γ.recBodies n ≠ none`,
and the "widened" capstone would have spoken about exactly the same programs as the
`hnorec` one — while hiding the restriction inside a premise instead of naming it in the
ledger.

**Slice Γ-W3.6b removed that objection.** `DeltaHyps.nonrecursive` is deleted and the
bridge's step 6 walks the recursive exit, so a cold run *can* reach the exit that stores a
`.fix` entry and the bridge reports it in the δ record (`RunConclδ.recBlock`). The
premise is no longer uninhabited, and `nonrec_exit_stores_no_fix` below keeps its other
meaning: `.fix` entries come from the recursive exit and nowhere else.

**Slice Γ-W4 made the trade.** `hnorec` is gone from both capstones. What replaced it, in
one line each:

* the premise: `hcov : … → RecCovered Γ Esrc sf`, the converse of `Hreg` — see its table
  row for the classification, and `gRecCoveredD8`/`gRecCoveredFO` for the suppliability
  check that δ-D8e's objection demanded and this slice can now pass;
* the derivation: `ColdStartDelta.recEnvConsistent_of_deltaMem_walked`, reusing the
  capstone's own `hdisj`/`hclenv`/`huni`;
* the guard: the `RecursiveGuard` section at the end of this file, where the deleted
  premise is not merely unused but **refuted** (`ΓFOrec_norec_refuted`).

What the trade did *not* cost, against the δ-D8e prediction: no single-block restriction
(the conversion is keyed per name), no motive change, no new machinery, and no axiom.
What it does still cost is one restriction, and it lives one level in rather than on the
program: a walked block's bodies call only siblings, registered constructors and registered
`casesOn`s (`Hβ`'s row). Everything the capstones say about a recursive program is said
modulo that. -/

/-- **The non-recursive exit stores no block.** `visitMutual`'s non-recursive exit cons
exactly the `visitExpr` output it just built, and every such output is fix-free
(`ColdStartInduction.visitExpr_noFix_closed`, no hypotheses). So a `.fix` entry in
`gdecls` can only come from the recursive exit — which since Γ-W3.6b the bridge's step 6
*walks*, and whose registration is therefore what `RecCovered` is an agreement about. -/

/-! ## Non-vacuity guards

### What is constructible here, and what is not

The obstructions are the ones every capstone guard in this development already carries,
plus one that is specific to the entry point:

* **the run** — no successful run of the erasure family is constructible in-logic (every
  branch passes through opaque `CoreM`/`MetaM` primitives and needs a real
  `ST.Ref`/world token), so `hrun` stays hypothetical, exactly as in the D3/D3ι guards;
* **the five runtime bundles** `H`/`HD`/`C`/`P`/`Hr` (`P` since proj-P8) and the two ι trust items
  (`IotaConsistent`, `IotaRelevant`) — same discipline;
* **the prepared subject** (`ColdStartSubject`, `hev`) — *new here*, and unavoidable: the
  entry point erases `prepare_erasure e`, which is the output of three opaque elaborator
  transforms, so nothing about it can be computed. This is the entry point's own version
  of the `NoBlock t` premise the warm guards already leave hypothetical.

Everything `Γ`-level is constructed, at the same `ΓFOι`/`iaFOι` pin the warm ι guard
uses: the fixvar exclusion, the peano-config pin, `IotaArityCoherent`, the
constructor/`casesOn` disjointness, and the value's first-orderness. The *recursion*
exclusion is no longer among them — since Γ-W4 these two guards supply
`RecCovered.of_noRec` instead, which is the same fact discharging a premise rather than a
scope restriction on the theorem; the guard that exercises the other side is
`RecursiveGuard`, at the end of this file. -/

/-- **The cold-start capstone fires.** At the registered inductive of the ι guard, on a
source whose prepared form evaluates to the first-order constructor `c`: `Erasure.erase`
returns a `Program` whose term reaches *the* unique applied-form erasure of `c`, in an
environment the run built. Hypothetical: the run, the five bundles, the two ι trust
items, and the prepared-subject facts — see the section docstring. -/

/-! ## The δ guard: a program that CALLS a walked function (slice D5)

The two guards above are the *old* ones, re-checked at the new statement: their fragment
is still `known = ⊥`, so they exercise the rewiring but not the δ. This section is the one
the slice exists for — **a two-declaration source**, `g := c` and a program that calls `g`.

### Where it fires, and where it cannot

At the **cold-start** entry point the subject is `prepare_erasure e`, the output of three
opaque elaborator transforms, so `pe` cannot be named and the source evaluation premise is
hypothetical whatever the fragment is. What the cold-start guard can therefore show — and
does, last in this section — is that the capstone's *statement* is now instantiable at a
genuinely non-empty fragment: `known` holds of `g`, `Esrc` records its body, the bridge
invariant is constructed at the empty state at that fragment (`gBridgeInv_nil`, `known` no
longer pinned at `⊥`), and the δ record is *derived* from the walk.

The δ **step** is exercised one level down, at the warm capstone, whose subject can be
named: `shipping_erase_correct_firstorder` on the program `.const g []`. There the source
evaluation really takes `SEvalDataC.delta`, and `ErasesEnvDeltaData` — the premise that
lets the *target* take its matching `WcbvEval` δ step — is produced by D5's conversion out
of a `DeltaMem`, not assumed. That pair is the whole point of δ-inclusion.

### What is constructed and what is not

Constructed: the environment (a real *definition* `g : I := c`, so `SEnvConsistent` is
discharged from `VEnv`'s own defining equation rather than assumed — the first time in this
development that premise is met at a non-empty `Esrc`), its well-formedness, the fragment,
the `Supported.const` derivation, the bridge invariant, the δ record and its walk
restriction, the source evaluation's δ step, and the value's first-orderness.

Hypothetical, all pre-existing classes: the run; the five runtime bundles; `NoBlock t`
(a statement about the run's output); and `harity` — the single lean4lean-blocked side
condition `FirstOrder.lean` documents, here restated at this environment. -/

(`SEvalDataC.delta`, `gSEvalδ`); the target side has the matching environment entry,
produced by D5's conversion out of the walk's own record (`gErasesEnvDeltaDataδ`); and the
constant reference is `Supported` because the fragment is non-empty — the derivation
`known = ⊥` used to kill.

Hypothetical: the run, the four bundles, `NoBlock t`, and `harity`. Everything else is
constructed, including the two premises that were previously discharged *vacuously* at

/-! ## The recursive guard: a cold start whose walked dependency is a mutual block (Γ-W4)

This is the section slice Γ-W4 exists for. Every cold-start guard above stands at a `Γ`
with `recBodies = ⊥` — which is what `hnorec` demanded of *every* program the capstones
spoke about. The premise is gone; here is the statement firing at a `Γ` where it would be
**false**.

### What is genuinely recursive here, and what is not

* `Γ` registers a real self-referential block: `ΓfixRec`'s `fixRecDefs` — `def f (a : Prop)
  := f a`, whose stored body is the closed `λa. #1 #0`, `#1` being the fix binder — grafted
  onto `ΓFOd`'s nullary constructor. `ΓFOrec_norec_refuted` is the measurement: the deleted
  premise is not merely unused at this fixture, it is refuted.
* the fragment contains the recursive constant (`knownRec `f`), and the source environment
  records its body (`EsrcRec`), so the run really may walk into `visitMutual`'s recursive
  exit — the one the bridge's step 6 walks since Γ-W3.6b and refuted before it;
* the coverage agreement's *gate* is inhabited on computed data at the state such a walk
  ends in (`gRecCoveredFO`), which is the S1d suppliability test for the premise that
  replaced `hnorec`.

**Why the block fixture is grafted onto `ΓFOd` rather than used bare.** `FirstOrderValue`
has exactly one constructor, `.ctor`, so at a `Γ` registering no constructor the capstone's
`hfo` premise is *uninhabited* and no conclusion can be stated at all. A recursive-only `Γ`
therefore cannot carry a first-order capstone; the fixture has to register both. That is a
fact about the statement, not about recursion.

### The vacuity this guard nearly was, and the environment that fixes it

The first version ran at `envFO` — `I : Sort 1`, `c : I` — and it proved **nothing**.
`DeltaHyps.esrc_shape` demands `∃ ve, TrExprS env Us [] pe ve` of every body the fragment
records, `fixRecSrc` mentions `.const f []`, and `envFO` does not declare `f`; so the `Hδ`
bundle is uninhabitable there and taking it hypothetically is taking `False`. The fix is
the environment: `envRec` declares `f` — as an **axiom** of type `Prop → I`, which is the
honest modelling, since a recursive definition has no kernel defining equation and that is
exactly why the eraser fetches `f._unsafe_rec`. `gRecEsrcShape` then discharges the field
that was unsatisfiable, and `gRecScope` the other three fragment-scope fields, so nothing
in the bundle is hypothetical *because it is empty*.

One premise came out better than expected. `hcon : SEnvConsistent` is **discharged**
(`envRec_senvConsistent`), and by η: the fixture's source body `fun (a : Prop) => f a` is
`f`'s η-expansion, and `VEnv.IsDefEq.eta` is a rule of lean4lean's theory. That is a
property of this fixture, not of recursion — a general recursive body is not η-equal to its
constant, and there the premise is what the ledger says it is. Worth recording either way,
because the structural fact behind it is not obvious: a well-formed `VEnv` *cannot* carry a
self-referential defining equation, since `VDecl.def` types a constant's value in the
environment before the constant is added. So for a general recursive constant `hcon` is
never the `envδ`-style defining-equation discharge; it is a trust item about a constant
whose only kernel form is `_unsafe_rec`.

### What stays hypothetical, and why each one has to

The run, the five runtime bundles (`H`/`HD`/`C`/`P`/`Hr`), the two recursion premises
(`Hβ`/`Hreg`), the residue `hstr` and the prepared subject (`S`/`hev`) — every one of them
a class the δ guard already leaves open, for reasons its own section docstring gives — and
one that is specific here:

* `hcov` itself. It speaks about the run's *final state*, which no in-logic term can name
  at a cold start, exactly as `hev` does. `gRecCoveredFO` below is the suppliability check
  that keeps it from being an invisible-unsatisfiable premise: at the state a walked
  recursive exit produces, it is a computation. -/

/-! ### The environment: `f` has to be declared, or the bundle is uninhabitable

The first attempt at this guard ran at `envFO` — `I : Sort 1`, `c : I`, nothing else — and
it was **vacuous**, for a reason worth keeping: `DeltaHyps.esrc_shape` demands
`∃ ve, TrExprS env Us [] pe ve` of every body the fragment records, and `fixRecSrc`
mentions `.const f []`. At an environment that does not declare `f` there is no such
translation, so `Hδ` is *uninhabitable* there and a guard taking it hypothetically proves
nothing. This is exactly the S1d/S1e failure mode, met from the environment side.

So the guard declares `f` — as an **axiom** of type `Prop → I`, which is the honest
modelling: a recursive definition has no kernel defining equation, which is why the eraser
fetches `f._unsafe_rec` in the first place. `gRecEsrcShape` then discharges the field that
was unsatisfiable, and nothing about the bundle is empty. -/

own defining equation, and not available at all for a constant whose only kernel form is

and — the one that was not expected to be constructible here — the source-side δ trust
item `hcon`, by η (`envRec_senvConsistent`).

**Hypothetical**: the run, the five runtime bundles, the two recursion premises
`Hβ`/`Hreg`, the residue `hstr`, the prepared subject `S`/`hev`, and `hcov`. Each is a
class the δ guard already leaves open; `hcov` speaks about the run's final state, which no
in-logic term can name at a cold start, and `gRecCoveredFO` is its suppliability check at
exactly the state a walked recursive exit produces. The bundles' fragment-scope halves are
not left to chance either: `gRecScope` and `gRecEsrcShape` discharge them at this fixture,
so nothing here is hypothetical *because it is empty*. -/

/-! ## The mutual guard: the capstone's recursion premise at a two-member block (Γ-W5)

`RecursiveGuard` above stands at `ΓfixRec` — a *self*-referential block of one definition,
which is all `DeltaHyps.decl_run` admitted before Γ-W5. This section carries what the same
premises look like at `Erases.lean`'s `ΓfixMut` (`def f a := g a` / `def g a := f a`), and
it stops where the fixture stops being constructible, which is the point of the section.

### What is constructed, and why it is the interesting half

`hcov : RecCovered Γ Esrc sf` is the premise that replaced `hnorec` at Γ-W4, and it is
`env`-free: a statement about `Γ`, `Esrc` and a state. So it can be *computed* at a genuine
two-member registration, and `gMutCoveredFO` is that computation — the mutual twin of
`gRecCoveredFO`, at the state a walked mutual exit produces. Two things it checks that the
one-block version cannot: the registration is looked up **once per sibling**, at the
*matching* index (`f ↦ (fixMutDefs, 0)`, `g ↦ (fixMutDefs, 1)` — swap them and
`recConstState_envLookup`'s membership premise fails), and the final environment holds
**three** distinct keys rather than two, so the block entries do not shadow each other or
the inductive one (`gMutKeysFO`).

### Where it stops: `hcon`, and why η does not reach a mutual pair

The full capstone instantiation needs an `env` declaring both names, and there the
`RecursiveGuard`'s one piece of luck runs out. `envRec_senvConsistent` discharges
`hcon : SEnvConsistent` **by η**: the self-referential fixture's body `fun a => f a` is its
own constant's η-expansion, so `VEnv.IsDefEq.eta` closes it. At a mutual pair the body of
`f` is `fun a => g a`, whose η-contraction is `g` and not `f` — so the premise forces
`env.IsDefEqU 0 [] (.const f []) (.const g [])`, a defeq **between the two siblings**.

That is stated as a theorem rather than asserted here:
`SubjectReductionFull.SEnvConsistent.siblings_collapse`, the sibling-side twin of Γ-U's
`SEnvConsistent.levels_collapse` and proved the same way (`hcon`, `TrExprS.uniq`, one
`VEnv.IsDefEq.eta`). Two distinct axioms do not satisfy its conclusion, so an `envMut` that
discharges `hcon` has to make the two members definitionally equal — concretely, declare
`g` as a kernel *definition* `g := f` (the `envδ`/`addDefEq` pattern) rather than as a
second axiom. That is constructible, and it is a fixture in which the block's two members
are the same function: the cross-references in `fixMutDefs` stay genuinely mutual on the
**target** side, which is where this slice's content is, but the source side degenerates.
Recorded rather than built, because a guard whose environment has to identify the two names
it exists to distinguish is worth naming before it is worth having, and because the general
reading is what matters:

> `hcon` at a mutual block is a demand about the block's members *jointly*, not a
> per-constant defining equation. The ledger row for `hcon` says it is "a fact about the
> elaborator, not about the walk"; at a mutual block it is a fact about the elaborator
> relating **two** constants, and neither the `envδ` defining-equation discharge nor the
> `envRec` η discharge generalises to it.

It lands in the same place as Γ-U's finding: the premise is stronger than the kernel fact
exactly where the fragment was being widened. Unlike Γ-U it does **not** block the slice —
`hcon` is a capstone premise, not a bundle field, so a mutual block is in scope for the
bridge and for `DeltaHyps` either way; what is not yet exhibited is one end-to-end capstone
at a mutual `Γ`. -/

section ProjectionGuard

/-! ## The projection guard: a `Γ` that REGISTERS a structure (slice P9)

The two `known = ⊥` guards above run at `ΓFOι`, which registers no structure, so they
exercise the P9 rewiring the way the pre-Γ-W4 guards exercised `hnorec`: by discharging
the new premise vacuously (`projConsistent_of_noProjs rfl`). This section is the other
side — the `RecursiveGuard` pattern, transposed onto the projection column.

The fixture is `ΓprojQ` (`VisitExprRefines.lean`, guard (v) of the bridge), the round's own
context: `MyOfNat` registered as a **two-parameter, one-field** structure, with
`ctorArities MyOfNat.mk = 3 = 2 + 1`. Non-degeneracy matters twice here — a `Γ` whose
structure had no fields would satisfy `ProjFieldsCoherent` by `0 = 0 + 0`, and a proof
that confused `paramCount` with `fieldIdx` would still close.

**Constructed**: the refutation of the deleted premise (`ΓprojQ_noprojs_refuted`);
`ProjFieldsCoherent` (`ΓprojQ_projFieldsCoherent`), which is the `Γ`-side input of the
`ProjConsistent` discharge and, at the *capstone*, the fact P9 derives from the walk; the
fixvar and peano-config pins; the constructor/`casesOn` disjointness; the source-side δ
item at the empty fragment; and the two recursion premises at `⊥`.

**Hypothetical**, and each in a class this file already carries: the run; the five runtime
bundles `H`/`HD`/`C`/`P`/`Hr`; the residue `hstr`; the ι trust items; the prepared
subject `S`/`hev`; and `henv`/`hfo`, which are *newly* hypothetical here — `ΓprojQ` records
no first-order constructor at all (its only constructor is the structure's, whose arguments
are the two type parameters), so no value of the fragment can be exhibited, and the guard is
stated at an arbitrary well-formed `env` rather than at `envQ`, whose `Ordered` this pin
cannot supply (`VEnv.Ordered` has no `addPat` clause — `ProjPattern.lean`'s module note).
That is a deliberate weakening: `env` universally quantified is a stronger statement than
`env := envQ` would be, and the env-side content is exercised by the `ΓFOι` guards above.

**Two premises stop being free here**, which is the point of running the guard at this `Γ`:

* `P : ProjBridgeHyps ΓprojQ` can no longer be instantiated by `ProjBridgeHyps.of_bot` —
  both its clauses are keyed on `Γ.projs S = some _`, which now fires. The fourth bundle is
  genuinely assumed for the first time at a capstone;
* `Hr.satProjs`'s gate is inhabited (`ΓprojQ_projs`), so the field is not satisfiable
  only-vacuously — the S1d/S1e failure mode, checked here for the column P9 added.

And `hproj` is discharged along the route the ledger names — `projConsistent_of_coh`, on
the *constructed* `ProjFieldsCoherent` — leaving, since the `b6a5a38` re-pin, exactly
**one** upstream-gated item rather than two: `ProjDefeqSpec` (`TrEnv.proj_defeq`,
statement corrected, proof still deferred). `ProjCtorAgree` is now derivable
(`projCtorAgree_of_trEnv`), and `gProjConsistentQ_of_trEnv` below fires that route at this
fixture, so the shrink is measured here and not merely asserted in the ledger. -/

/-- **The premise slice P9 deleted is FALSE at this fixture.** `ΓFOrec_norec_refuted`'s
transpose: `hnoprojs : Γ.projs = ⊥` is not merely unused below, it is refutable, so the
capstone's widening is real rather than a re-phrasing. -/
theorem ΓprojQ_noprojs_refuted : ¬ (ΓprojQ.projs = fun _ => none) := by
  intro h
  have hq := congrFun h `MyOfNat
  rw [ΓprojQ_projs] at hq
  simp at hq

/-- **`ProjFieldsCoherent` at the fixture, non-degenerately.** `MyOfNat.mk`'s arity `3`
decomposes as `2` parameters `+ 1` field, so the equation the target selection needs —
`args[paramCount + fieldIdx]` lands on the field — is checked against real arithmetic. -/

    obtain rfl : nfs = [1] := by simpa [ΓprojQ] using hnfs.symm

    · subst hcn
      exact ⟨by simp, by simp [ΓprojQ]⟩
    · simp [ΓprojQ, hcn] at hctors
  · simp [ΓprojQ, hSn] at hS

/-- **The re-pin's shrink, at this fixture.** `hproj` used to need *two* premises no
downstream declaration could produce; since `b6a5a38` a caller holding a `TrEnv` — the
`kenv`↔`env` alignment the ι round already uses to discharge `PatsIotaSpec` — supplies the
constructor agreement for real, off upstream's `TrEnv.pats_iota_inv`.

What is left hypothetical is `ProjDefeqSpec` (upstream's proof is still `sorry`) and
`ProjRecRules`, the kernel-side rules↔ctors certificate that replaces it — free at every
`Γ` predating the projection round (`projRecRules_of_noProjs`) and stated rather than
computed here for the same reason `ProjShape`'s `find?` conjuncts are: a
`Kernel.Environment` is opaque in-logic.

The `ProjFieldsCoherent` input is the *constructed* one, so the only thing this guard
takes on trust is the pair above. -/

    ΓprojQ.ctors cn = some (iid, cidx) → ΓprojQ.casesOns cn = none := fun _ => rfl

/-- **The cold-start ι capstone fires at a `Γ` that registers a structure** (projection
round, slice P9). `Erasure.erase`, from the empty state, at the round's own context: the
two environment records the ι simulation needs on the projection column —
`ErasesEnvProjs` and `ProjFieldsCoherent` — are **derived** inside the capstone from the
registry invariant's new column, and the premise that used to stand in for them,
`hnoprojs : Γ.projs = ⊥`, is refuted here (`ΓprojQ_noprojs_refuted`).

What is left on the projection side is `hproj`, discharged below through
`projConsistent_of_coh` from `ProjDefeqSpec` — the one upstream-gated item left after the
`b6a5a38` re-pin — the derivable `ProjCtorAgree`, and the constructed
`ΓprojQ_projFieldsCoherent`. This guard keeps `hagree` hypothetical so that it stays the
general `VEnv`-level statement of the capstone; `gProjConsistentQ_of_trEnv` above is where
the re-pin's discharge is exercised. See the section docstring for the
constructed/hypothetical split and for the two premises that stop being free at this `Γ`. -/
